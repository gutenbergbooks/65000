  <h2 class='c010'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Homeric</span> archæology has, within the last few years,
finally left the groove of purely academic discussion
to advance along the new route laid down for it by
practical methods of investigation. The results are
full of present interest, and of future promise. They
already imply a reconstruction of the Hellenic past;
they vitalise the Homeric world, bringing it into
definite relations with what went before, and with
what came after, and transforming it from a poetical
creation into an historical reality. Excavations and
explorations in Greece, Egypt, and Asia Minor, have
thus entirely changed the aspect of the perennial
Homeric problem, and afford reasonable hope of
providing it with a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p class='c011'>These remarkable, and promptly-gathered fruits
of an experimental system of inquiry deserve the attention,
not of scholars alone, but of every educated
person; nevertheless, their value has as yet been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>realised by a very limited class. The following chapters
may then, it is hoped, usefully serve to illustrate
some of them for the benefit of the general reading
public, while making no pretension to discuss, formally
or exhaustively, the wide subject of Homeric
antiquities. For the proper discharge of that task,
indeed, qualifications would be needed to which the
writer lays no claim. The object of the present little
work will be attained if it contribute to stir a wider
interest in the topics it discusses; above all, should
it in any degree help to promote a non-erudite study
of the noble poetical monuments it is concerned with.
Greek enough to read the Iliad and Odyssey in the
original can be learned with comparative ease; and
what trouble there may be in its acquisition meets an
ample reward in mental profit and enjoyment of a
high order. These ancient epics have a unique freshness
about them; they are still open founts of
animating pleasure for all who choose to apply to
them; one cannot, then, but regret that so few have
intellectual energy to do so.</p>
<p class='c011'>The author’s best thanks are due to Messrs. Macmillan,
and to Messrs. Hodder and Stoughton, for
their courteous permission to reprint the chapters
entitled ‘Homeric Astronomy,’ ‘Homer’s Magic
Herbs,’ and ‘The Dog in Homer,’ originally published
in the pages of <i>Nature</i>, <i>Macmillan’s Magazine</i>, and
the <i>British Quarterly Review</i> respectively.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>In quoting illustrative passages from the Homeric
poems, considerable use has been made of the admirable
prose version of the Iliad by Messrs. Lang, Leaf,
and Myers, and of the Odyssey by Messrs. Butcher
and Lang. With the object, however, of securing a
certain variety of effect, versified translations have
also been resorted to, their authors being duly specified
in foot-notes. The citations of Helbig’s valuable
work, <i>Das Homerische Epos aus den Denkmälern
erläutert</i>, refer to the second enlarged edition published
in 1887.</p>

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c010'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br />HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> perennial youth of the Homeric poems is without
a parallel in the history of art. No other imaginative
works have so nearly succeeded in bidding
defiance to the ‘tooth of time.’ Like the golden
watch-dogs of Alcinous, they seem destined to be
‘deathless and ageless all their days.’ Nor is theirs
the faded immortality of Tithonus—the bare preservation
of a material form emptied of the glow of
vitality, and grown out of harmony with its environment.
Their survival is not even that of an ‘Attic
shape’ whose undeniable beauty has, in our eyes,
assumed somewhat of a recondite coldness, very
different from the loveliness of old, when connoisseurship
was not needed for appreciation. The Iliad
and Odyssey are still auroral. They have the
charm of an ‘unpremeditated lay,’ springing from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the very source of our own life; they appeal alike
to rude sensibilities and to cultivated tastes; their
splendour and pathos, their powerful vitality, the
strength and swiftness of their numbers, require to
be accentuated by no critical notes of admiration;
they strike of themselves the least tutored native
perception. These vigorous growths out of the
deep soil of humanity have not yet been transported
from the open air of indiscriminate enjoyment
into the greenhouse of æstheticism; delight in them
lays hold of any schoolboy capable of reading them
fluently in the original as naturally as enthralment
with ‘Cinderella’ or ‘Jack the Giant-Killer’ commands
the unreflecting nursery. For they combine,
as no other primitive poetry does, imaginative energy
with sobriety of thought and diction. The <i>ne quid
nimis</i> regulates all their scenes. They are simple
without being archaic, fervid without extravagance,
fanciful, yet never grotesque. The strict proprieties
of classic form effectually restrain in them the exuberance
of romantic invention. Not that any such
distinctions in the mode of composition had then
begun to be thought of. The poet was unconsciously
a ‘law unto himself.’ Indeed the very potency of his
creative faculty prescribed retrenchment and moderation;
the images conjured up by it with much of the
plastic reality of sculpture subjecting themselves spontaneously
to the laws of sculpturesque fitness. Clear-cut
and firm of outline, they move in the transparent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>ether of definite thought. Projected into the vaporous
atmosphere of a riotous fancy, they might show
vaster, but they could hardly be equally impressive.</p>

<p class='c015'>But these matchless productions are not merely
the ‘wood-notes wild’ of untrained inspiration. They
imply a long course of free development under favourable
conditions. The vehicle of expression used in
them might alone well be the product of centuries of
pre-literary culture. Greek hexameter verse was by
no means an obvious contrivance. It is an exceedingly
subtle structure, depending for its effect—nay,
for its existence—upon unvarying obedience to a
complex set of metrical rules. These could not have
originated all at once, by the decree of some poetical
law-giver. They must have been arrived at more or
less tentatively by repeated experiments, the recognised
success of which led, in the slow course of time,
to their general adoption.</p>

<p class='c015'>Moreover, the legendary materials of the Epics
were not dug straight out of the mine of popular
fancy and tradition. They had doubtless been elaborated
and manipulated, before Homer took them in
hand, by generations of singers and reciters. The
‘tale of Troy divine’ was already a full-leaved tree
when he plucked from it and planted the branches
destined to flourish through the ages. His verses
display or betray acquaintance with many ‘other
stories’ of public notoriety besides those completely
unfolded in them. The fate of Agamemnon, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>death of Achilles, the madness of Ajax, the advent of
Neoptolemus, the slaying of Memnon, son of the
Morning, the ambush in the Wooden Horse, the
mysterious wanderings of Helen, the last journey of
Odysseus, furnished themes of surpassing interest,
all or most of which had been made into songs for
the pastime of lordly feasters and the solace of noble
dames, before the wrath of Achilles suggested a more
adventurous flight. Inexhaustible, indeed, was the
store of romantic adventure furnished by the famous
ten years’ siege.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>But the saga-literature of the Greeks did not begin
with the mustering of the fleet at Aulis. The ‘ante-Troica’
were not neglected. Many a ballad was
chanted about the doings of those ‘strong men’ who
‘lived before Agamemnon,’ although it was not their
fortune to be commemorated by a supreme singer.
That supreme singer, however, knew much concerning
the Argonauts, the War of Thebes, the Calydonian
Boar-hunt, the sorrows of Niobe, and the betrayal of
Bellerophon; ante-Trojan lays served as parables for
the instruction of Clytemnestra, and the recreation
of Achilles in that disastrous interval when he doffed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>his armour and strung his lyre. And a small but
privileged class of the community was devoted, under
the presumed tuition of the Muses, to the perfecting
and perpetuation of these treasures of poetic lore.</p>

<p class='c015'>Homer was accordingly no unprepared phenomenon.
He rose in a sky already luminous. The
flowering of his genius, indeed, marked the close of
an epoch. His achievements were of the definitive
and synthetic kind; they summed up and surpassed
what had previously been accomplished; they were
the outcome—although not the necessary outcome—of
a multitude of minor performances.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now it is impossible to admit the prevalence of
such sustained poetical activity as the Homeric Epics
by their very nature postulate, apart from the existence
of a tolerably widespread and well-regulated
social organisation. They besides describe a polity
which was certainly not imaginary, and thus lead us
back to a pre-Hellenic world, different in many ways
from historical Greece, and separated from it by
several blank and silent centuries. The people who
moved and suffered, and nurtured their loves and
grudges in it, were called ‘Achæans’—the ethnical
title given by Homer to his countrymen from all
parts of the Greek peninsula and its adjacent islands.
Homer himself was evidently an Achæan; Achilles,
Agamemnon, and Odysseus, Helen and Penelope,
sprang from the same race, which was an offshoot
from the general Hellenic stock. They were a seafaring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>people, but not much given to commerce;
active, energetic, sensitive, highly imaginative, they
showed, nevertheless, receptivity rather than inventiveness
as regards the practical arts of life. Their
great national exploit was probably that bellicose
expedition to the Troad upon which the Ilian legend,
with all its mythical accretions, was founded; and
some records of attacks by them on Egypt have
been deciphered on hieroglyphically-inscribed monuments;
but they can claim no assured place in
history. As a nation, they ceased indeed to exist
before the dim epoch of fables came to an end; the
Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesus brought about
their political annihilation and social disintegration,
impelling them, nevertheless, to establish new settlements
in Asia Minor, and thus setting on foot the
long process by which Greek culture became cosmopolitan.</p>

<p class='c015'>Homeric conditions do not then represent simply
an initial stage in classic Greek civilisation. There
was no continuous progress from the one state of
things to the other. Development was interrupted
by revolution. Hence, much irretrievable loss and
prolonged seething confusion; until, out of the chaos,
a renovated order emerged, and the Greece of the
Olympiads comes to view in the year 776 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c015'>For this reason Homeric Greece is strange to
history; the relative importance of the states included
in it, the centre of gravity of its political power, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>modes of government and manners of men it displays,
are all very different from what they had
become in the time of Herodotus. But it is only of
late that these differences have come to have an intelligible
meaning. Until expounded by archæological
research, they were a source of unmixed perplexity to
the learned. The state of society described by Homer
could certainly not be regarded as fictitious; yet it
hung suspended, as it were, in the air, without
definite limitations of time or place. These uncertainties
have now been removed. The excavations at
Mycenæ, undertaken by Dr. Schliemann in 1876,
may be said to have had for their upshot the rediscovery
of the old Achæan civilisation, the material
relics of which have been brought to light from the
‘shaft-tombs’ of Agamemnon’s citadel, the ‘bee-hive
tombs’ of the lower city, in the palaces and other
coeval buildings of Tiryns, Mycenæ, and Orchomenos.
The points of agreement between Homeric delineations
and Mycenæan antiquities are, in fact, too
numerous to permit the entertainment of any reasonable
doubt that the poet’s experience lay in the daily
round of Mycenæan life—of life, that is to say,
governed by the same ideas and carried on under
approximately the same conditions with those prevailing
through the ancient realm of the sons of Atreus.</p>

<p class='c015'>The detection of this close relationship has lent a
totally new aspect to what is called the Homeric
Question, widening its scope at the same time that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>it provides a sure basis for its discussion. For this
can no longer be disconnected from inquiries into the
status and fortunes of the great confederacy, out of
the wreck of which the splendid fabric of Hellenic
society arose. The civilisation centred at Mycenæ
covered a wide range; how wide we do not yet fully
know: the results of future explorations must be
awaited before its limits can be fixed. It undoubtedly
spread, however, beyond Greece proper through the
Sporades to Crete, Rhodes, the coasts of Asia Minor,
and even to Egypt. The traces left behind by it in
Egypt are of particular importance.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><b>[2]</b></a> From the
Mycenæan pottery discovered in the Fayûm, tangible
proof has been derived that the Græco-Libyan assaults
upon that country were to some extent effective, and
that the seafaring people who took part in them were
no other than the Homeric Achæans, then in an
early stage of their career. The fact of their having
secured a foothold in the Nile Valley accounts, too, for
the strong Egyptian element in Mycenæan art; and
the evidence of habitual intercourse is further curiously
strengthened by the presence of an ostrich egg
amid the other antique remains in the Myceneæan
citadel graves.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><b>[3]</b></a> Above all, the Egypto-Mycenæan
pottery, from its association with other objects of
known dates, is determinable as to time. And it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>appears, as the outcome of Mr. Flinders Petrie’s careful
comparisons, that one class of vases, adorned with
linear patterns, goes back to about 1400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, while
those exhibiting naturalistic designs were freely manufactured
in 1100. The culminating period, however,
of pre-Hellenic fictile art is placed considerably earlier,
in 1500-1400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and there are indications that its
development had occupied several previous centuries.
Mr. Petrie, indeed, finds himself compelled to believe
that the Græco-Libyan league was already active in
or before the year 2000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Achæan predominance
may, then, very well have boasted a millennium of antiquity
when the Dorians crossed the Gulf of Corinth.
Its subversion drove many of the leading native
families over the Ægean, where they found seats
already doubtless familiar to them through their own
and their ancestors’ maritime and piratical adventures,
and the colonising impulse once given, did not
soon cease to promote the enlargement of the Greek
domain. But the mass of the Achæan people lived
on in their old homes, in a state of subjection resembling
that of the Saxons in England after the Norman
Conquest. They were designated ‘Periœci’ by their
Dorian rulers.</p>

<p class='c015'>Archæological discoveries have thus shown the
largeness of the historical issues embraced in the
Homeric Question; they also afford the possibility,
and still more, the promise, of satisfactorily answering
it. The problem is threefold. It includes the consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of where, when, and how the great Epics
were composed.</p>

<p class='c021'>competed for the honour of having given birth to
their author. Wherever, in short, their study was
localised by the foundation of a school of ‘Homerids,’
there was asserted to be the native place of the eponymous
bard. The truth is that no really authentic
tradition regarding him reached posterity. The
very name of ‘Homer,’ or the ‘joiner together,’
is obviously rather typical than personal; and it
gradually came to aggregate round it all that was
antique and unclaimed in the way of verse. The
aggregation, it is true, was presumably formed in
Asiatic Ionia; the ‘Cyclic Poems,’ supplementary
to the Iliad, were mainly the work of Ionic poets;
and the Epic was substantially an Ionic dialect.
Yet the inference of an Asiatic origin thence naturally
arising now clearly appears to be invalid. The linguistic
argument, to begin with, has been completely
disposed of by Fick’s remarkable demonstration that
the Iliad and Odyssey underwent an early process of
Ionicisation.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><b>[4]</b></a> So far as metrical considerations permitted,
they were actually translated from the Æolic,
or rather Achæan tongue, in which they were composed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>into the current idiom of Colophon and
Miletus. Objections urged from this side against
their production in Europe have accordingly lost
their force; and the reasons favouring it, always
strong, have of late grown to be well-nigh irresistible.
Some of the more cogent were briefly stated by Mr.
D. B. Monro in 1886;<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><b>[5]</b></a> and others might now be
added. One only, but one surely conclusive, need
here be mentioned. It is this. Homer could not
have been an Asiatic Greek, because Asiatic Greece
did not exist in Homer’s time. He was aware of no
Achæan settlements in Asia Minor; not one of the
twelve cities of the Ionian confederacy emerges in the
Catalogue, Miletus only excepted, and Miletus with a
special note of ‘barbarian’ habitation attached to it.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><b>[6]</b></a>
The Ionian name is, in the Iliad, once applied to the
Athenians<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><b>[7]</b></a> (presumably), but does not occur at all in
the Odyssey; where, on the other hand, Dorians,
unknown in the Iliad, are casually named as forming
an element in the mixed population of Crete.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><b>[8]</b></a> The
reputed birthplaces of Homer, then, on the eastern
coast of the Ægean, were, when he had reached his
singing prime, still occupied by Carians and Mæonians;
and we must accordingly look for his origin in
the West. There is no escape from this conclusion
except by the subterfuge of imagining the geography
of the Epics to be artificially archaic. They related
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to a past time, it might be said, they should then
reproduce the conditions of the past. But this is a
notion essentially modern. No primitive poet ever
troubled himself about such scruples of congruity.
Nor if he did, could the requisite detailed information
by possibility be at his command, while his painful
care to avoid what we call anachronisms would cause
nothing but perplexity to his unsophisticated audience.
Homer’s map of Greece must accordingly be accepted
as a true picture of what came under his personal
observation. It is, indeed, as Mr. Freeman says, ‘so
different from the map of Greece at any later time
that it is inconceivable that it can have been invented
at any later time.’<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><b>[9]</b></a> Since, however, it affords the
Greek race no Asiatic standing ground, it follows of
necessity that Homer was a European.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>This same consideration helps to determine the
age in which he lived. Homeric geography is entirely
pre-Dorian. Total unconsciousness of any
such event as the Dorian invasion reigns both in the
Iliad and Odyssey. Not a hint betrays acquaintance
with the fact that the polity described in them had, in
the meantime, been overturned by external violence.
A silence so remarkable can be explained only by the
simple supposition that when they were composed,
the revolution in question had not yet occurred.
Other circumstances confirm this view. Practical explorations
have shown pre-Hellenic Greece to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>been the seat of a rich, enterprising, and cultivated
nation. They have hence removed objections on the
score of savagery, inevitably to be encountered, formerly
urged against pushing the age of Homer very
far back into the past. The life carried on at
Mycenæ, in fact, twelve or thirteen centuries before
the Christian era, was in many respects more refined
than that depicted in the poems. It was known to
their author only after it had lost something of its
pristine splendour. But the Mycenæan civilisation
of his experience, if a trifle decayed, was complete
and dominant; and this it never was subsequently to
the Dorian conquest. To have collected, however,
into an imaginary organic whole the fragments into
which it had been shattered by that catastrophe,
would assuredly have been a task beyond his powers.
Nothing remains, then, but to admit that he lived in
the pre-Dorian Greece which he portrayed. Moreover,
the state of seething unrest ensuing upon the
overthrow of the Mycenæan order must have been
absolutely inconsistent with the development of a
great school of poetry. If Homer, then, was a European—as
appears certain—the inference is irresistible
that he flourished before the society to which he
belonged was thrown by foreign invaders into irredeemable
disarray—that is, at some section of the
Mycenæan epoch.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are many convincing reasons for holding
that section to have been a late one. One of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>principal is the familiar use of iron in the poems,
although none has been met with in the old shaft-tombs
within the citadel of Mycenæ, and only small
quantities in the less distinguished graves below. It
is, to be sure, conceivable that a substance introduced
as a vulgar novelty devoid of traditional or
ancestral associations might have been employed for
the ordinary purposes of everyday life long before it
was allowed to form part of sepulchral equipments;
a similar motive prescribing its virtual exclusion from
the Homeric Olympus. Still, the discrepancy can
hardly be explained away without the concession of
some lapse of time as well.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Homeric and Mycenæan modes of burial, too,
were different. Cremation is practised throughout
the Epics; the Mycenæan dead were preserved intact.
‘The contrast,’ Dr. Leaf remarks,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><b>[10]</b></a> ‘is a striking one;
but it is easy to lay too much stress upon it. It may
well be that the conditions of sepulture on a campaign
were perforce different from those usual in
times of peace at home. The mummifying of the
body and the carrying of it to the ancestral burying-place
in the royal citadel were not operations such as
could be easily effected amidst the hurry of marches
or the privations of a siege; least of all after the
slaughter of a pitched battle. It is therefore quite
conceivable that two methods of sepulture may of
necessity have been in use at the same time. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>for this assumption the Iliad itself gives us positive
grounds. One warrior who falls is taken home to be
buried; for to a dead son of Zeus means of carriage
and preservation can be supplied which are not for
common men. Sarpedon is cleansed by Apollo, and
borne by Death and Sleep to his distant home in
Lycia, not that his body may be burnt, but that his
brethren and kinsfolk may <i>preserve</i> it ‘with a tomb
and gravestone, for such is the due of the dead.’</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The Mycenæan custom of embalming corpses was
not, then, strange to Homer; and the Homeric custom
of burning them has <i>perhaps</i>—for the evidence is indecisive—left
traces in the more recent graves of the
Mycenæan people. What is certain is that simple
interment was everywhere primitively in use, and
that the pyre was a subsequent innovation, at first
only partially adopted, and perhaps nowhere exclusively
in vogue.</p>

<p class='c015'>The plastic art of Mycenæ seems to have been
on the decline when the ‘sovran poet’ arose. This
can be inferred from the wondering admiration displayed
in his verses for what must once have been its
ordinary performances, as well as from the marked
superiority assigned in them to foreign over native
artists. They include besides no allusion to the
signet-rings so plentiful at Mycenæ, no notice, in any
connexion, of the art of gem-engraving, nor of the
indispensable luxury—to ladies of high degree—of
toilet-mirrors. Active intercourse with Egypt, again,
had evidently ceased long prior to the Homeric age.
The Nile is, in the poems, not even known by name,
but only as the ‘river of Egypt;’ and the country is
reached, not in the ordinary course of navigation,
but through recklessness or ill-luck, by adventurers
or castaways.</p>

<p class='c015'>We can now gather the following indications regarding
the date of the Homeric poems. They must
have originated during the interval between the
Trojan War—which, in some shape, may be accepted
as an historical event—and the Dorian invasion of
the Peloponnesus. They probably originated not
very long before the latter event, when the Mycenæan
monarchy was of itself tottering towards a fall
precipitated by the frequently repeated incursions of
ruder tribes from the north. The generally accepted
date for the final event is eighty years after the
taking of Troy, or 1104 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> But this rests on no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>authentic circumstance, and may very well be a century
or more in error. A preferable chronological arrangement
would place Homer’s flourishing in the
eleventh century, and the overthrow of Mycenæ near
its close. Difficulties of sundry kinds can thus be,
in a measure, evaded or conciliated, without encroaching
overmuch on the voiceless centuries available for
the unrecorded readjustment of the disturbed elements
of Greek polity.</p>

<p class='c015'>As to the mode of origin of the two great poems
which have come down to us from so remote an age,
much might be said; but a few words must here
suffice. It is a topic on which the utmost diversity
of opinion has prevailed since F. A. Wolf published,
in 1795, his famous ‘Prolegomena,’ and as to which
unity of views seems now for ever unattainable. For
demonstrative evidence is naturally out of the question,
and estimates of opposing probabilities are apt
to be strongly tinctured with ‘personality.’ Prepossessions
of all kinds warp the judgment, even in
purely literary matters, and, in this case especially,
have led to the learned advocacy of extreme opinions.
Thus, partisans of destructive criticism have carried
the analysis of the Homeric poems to the verge of
annihilation; while ultra-conservatives insist upon a
seamless whole, and regard the Iliad and the Odyssey
as the work of Homer, in the same sense and with
the same implicit confidence that they hold the Æneid
and the Eclogues to be Virgilian, or ‘Paradise Lost’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and ‘Samson Agonistes’ to be Miltonic productions.
Between these widely diverging paths, however, there
is a middle way laid down by common sense, which
it is tolerably safe to follow. A few simple considerations
may help us to find it.</p>

<p class='c015'>We must remember, in the first place, that the
Homeric poems were composed, not to be privately
read, but to be publicly recited. They remained unwritten
during at least a couple of centuries, flung on
the waves of unaided human memory. Oral tradition
alone preserved them; and not the punctilious oral
tradition of a sacerdotal caste like the Brahmins, but
that of a bold and innovating class of ‘rhapsodes,’
themselves aspiring to some share in the Muse’s immediate
favours, and prompt to flatter the local
vanities and immemorial susceptibilities of their
varied audiences. Within very wide limits, they were
free to ‘improve’ what long training had enabled
them to appropriate. Their licence infringed no literary
property; there was no authorised text to be corrupted;
one man’s version was as good as another’s.
It is not, then, surprising that the primitive order of
the Epics became here and there disarranged, or
that interpolated and substituted passages usurped
positions from which they could not afterwards easily
be expelled. Expository efforts have, indeed, sometimes
succeeded only in adding fresh knots to the
already tangled skein. Pisistratus, however, did good
service by for the first time <i>editing</i> the Homeric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>poems.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><b>[12]</b></a> Scattered manuscripts of them had doubtless
existed long previously; but it was their collection
and collation at Athens, and the disposal in
a determinate succession of the still disjointed
materials they afforded, which placed the Greek
people in the earliest full possession of their epical
inheritance.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f12'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>German critics doubt the fact. See Niese, <i>Die Entwickelung
der Homerischen Poesie</i>, p. 5.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>As the general result of a century of Homeric
controversy, instinctive appreciation may be said
broadly to have got the better of verbal criticism.
Not but that the latter has done valuable work; but
it is now pretty plainly seen to have been, in some
quarters, carried considerably too far. The triumphs
enjoyed by German advocates of the ‘Kleinliedertheorie’—of
the disjunction, that is to say, of the
Epics into numerous separate lays—are generally recognised
to have been merely temporary. A large
body of opinion was, at the outset, captivated by their
arguments; it has of late tended to swing back
towards some approximation to the old orthodoxy.
There is, indeed, much difficulty in conceiving the
profound and essential unity apparent to unprejudiced
readers of the Iliad and Odyssey to be illusory; nor
should it be forgotten that the evoking of a cosmos
from a chaos implies a single regulative intelligence.
And a cosmos each poem might very well be called;
while the ‘embryon atoms’ from which they sprang,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of legends, stories, myths, and traditions, constituted
scarcely less than an</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>Ocean without bound,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without dimension; where length, breadth, and highth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And time, and place, are lost.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Odyssey and the Iliad, however, stand in this
respect by no means on the same footing. In the
former, fundamental unity is obvious; the development
of the plot is logical and continuous; there are
no considerable redundancies, no superfluous adventures,
no oblivious interludes; the sense of progress
towards a purposed end pervades the whole. Careful
scrutiny, it is true, detects, in the details of the
narrative, some few trifling discrepancies; but attempts
to remove them by tampering with the general
plan of its structure lead at once to intolerable anomalies.
So much cannot be said for the Iliad. Here
the component strata are manifestly dislocated, and
some intruded masses can be clearly identified. Thus
the Tenth Book at once detaches itself both in substance
and style from the remaining cantos. It narrates
an adventure wholly disconnected from the
main action unfolded in them, and narrates it with a
coolness and easy fluency very unlike the rush and
glow of genuine Iliadic verse. Few, accordingly, are
the critics who venture to claim the episode, brilliant
and interesting though it be, as an integral part
of the original poem. Yet even when it has been set
aside, things do not go altogether straight. The basis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of the story is furnished by the wrath of Achilles and
its direful consequences; but while the hero sulks in
his tent, a good deal of miscellaneous and largely
irrespective fighting proceeds, during which he sinks
out of sight, and is only transiently kept in mind.
Zeus himself is allowed to forget his solemn promise
to Thetis of avenging, through the defeat of the
Greeks, the injury done to her son by Agamemnon;
and the Olympian machinery generally works in an
ill-regulated and haphazard fashion. Moreover, the
embassy of conciliation in the Ninth Book is ignored
later on; while the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth
Books, devoted mainly to the obsequies of Patroclus
and Hector, have by some critics been deemed superfluous,
by others inconsistent with an exordium announcing—as
Pope has it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Through the weight of these objections, Mr. Grote
felt compelled to dissever the Iliad into a primitive
part, which he called the Achilleid, and a mass of accessional
poetry, most likely of diverse origin and
date. And a similar view still prevails. Only that
the Achilleid has been cut down, by further retrenchments,
to the compass of a somewhat prolix
Lay, treating, as its express subject, of the ‘Wrath’
of Achilles. Dr. Leaf indeed accentuates the separation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>by upholding the probable origin, on opposite
sides of the Ægean, of the nuclear and adventitious
portions of the Epic.</p>

<p class='c015'>The force of some of the arguments urging to this
analysis cannot be denied, yet there are others, perhaps
of a higher order of importance, which indicate
the former predominance of a partially destroyed
entirety of design through by far the larger portion
of this wonderful prehistoric work. Speaking
broadly, an identical spirit pervades the whole. The
Tenth Book, and a few notoriously interpolated passages,
such as the feeble and futile Theomachy, make
the sole exceptions to this rule of ethical homogeneity.
Elsewhere, from beginning to end, we meet the same
spontaneous fervour of expression, the same magnificent
energy kept in hand like a spirited steed; an
unfailing sense of the splendour of heroic achievement,
and a glowing joy in human existence, tempered
by the heart-thrilling remembrance of its
pathetic mystery of sorrow. This prevalent uniformity
in manner and spirit is certainly unfavourable
to the hypothesis of divided authorship.</p>

<p class='c015'>The marvellous beauty and power of those sections
of the poem believed to be adventitious is also a
circumstance to be considered. They include many
of its most famous scenes—the parting of Hector and
Andromache, the arming of Athene, the meeting of
Glaucus and Diomed, and the whole vivid interlude
of Diomed’s prowess, the orations in the tent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Achilles, the chariot-race, the reception of Priam as
his suppliant by the fierce slayer of his son. To them
exclusively, above all, belongs the personal presentation
of Helen; outside their limits, she has no place
in the Iliad.</p>

<p class='c015'>These same accretions are not merely magnificent
in themselves, and rich in shining incidents, but they
add incalculably to the general effect of the Epic.
They contribute, in fact, a great part of its dramatic
force and the whole of its moral purport. Without
them it would be a bald and unfinished performance—the
abortive realisation of a sublime conception.
The arming of Agamemnon, for instance, and his
feats of private valour, could never have been designed
as the immediate sequel to the Promise of Zeus;
while they constitute a most fitting climax to the
series of the baffled Greek efforts for victory. They
are admirably prepared for by the stories of the duel
between Menelaus and Paris, of the broken pact, of
the prowess of Diomed, of the nocturnal embassy to
Achilles. Moreover, the irresistible might of Pelides
is brought with tenfold impressiveness on the scene
after the fighting powers of each of the other Achæan
chiefs have been fully displayed, and proved fruitless.
Above all, the Achillean drama itself would
lose its profound significance by the retrenchment of
the Ninth and two closing Books. For it was the
implacability of the ‘swift-footed’ hero that was justly
punished by the calamity of the death of Patroclus;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and he showed himself implacable only when he
haughtily rejected a formal offer of ample reparation.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><b>[13]</b></a>
At that point he became culpable; and might only
win revenge at the cost of the acutest anguish of
which his nature was capable. The Ninth Book, in
short, constitutes the ethical crisis of the Iliad; and
the moralising at second-hand, to the innermost core
of its structure, of a work purporting to be already
complete, is certainly a unique, if not an impossible
phenomenon.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f13'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. A. Lang urges this point with great effect in an article on
‘Homer and the Higher Criticism’ (<i>National Review</i>, Feb. 1892),
published after the present Chapter had been sent to press.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Nor is it easily credible that the ransom of the
body of Hector made no part of its fundamental plan.
Greek feelings of propriety would have been outraged—and
outraged in the most distasteful way—by disregard
of the dying petition of so spotless and disinterested
a champion, albeit of a lost cause, and by the
abandonment of his body as carrion to unclean beasts
and birds. And Achilles, without the elevating traits
of his courtesies in the Games, and his pity for
Priam, would have remained colossal only in brutality,
a blind instrument of fury, an example of the
triumph of ignoble instincts. But such a presentation
of his character could never have been purposed by
the author of the First Iliad. Not of this base stamp
was the hero whom Thetis rose from the sea to comfort.
For even in the first rush of his tremendous passion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>he still saw the radiant eyes and listened to the voice
of Athene; he did not wholly desert celestial wisdom;
and celestial wisdom could never have suffered the
balance of his stormy soul to be finally overthrown.
But just the needed compensatory touches are supplied
by his noble bearing in the Patroclean celebration,
and far more, by his chivalrous compassion for
the hapless old king of Troy. They could not have
been omitted by a poet of supreme genius—could not,
since the imagination has its logical necessities, among
which may be reckoned that of <i>equilibration</i>. There
is accordingly no possibility of founding a truly great
poem, wholly, or mainly, on the crude brutalities of
actual warfare. Humanity revolts from them in the
long run; and humanity prescribes its laws to art.
The slaughtering rage of Achilles demands a corresponding
height of generosity and depth of pity; it
would else be atrocious. His wrath, in fact, postulates
his tenderness; and hence the great difficulty
in believing that the singer of the First Book failed
to insert the Ninth, or stopped short at the Twenty-second
Book of the Iliad.</p>

<p class='c015'>The upshot of our little discussion, then, is to assign
both to the Iliad and Odyssey a European origin,
in the pre-Dorian time, when Mycenæ was the political
centre of the Achæan world. Provisionally, they
may be said to date from the eleventh century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
Moreover, the Odyssey in its essential integrity, and
the Iliad in large part, are each the work of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>master-mind. The Iliad, none the less, can no longer
be said to present a poem ‘of one projection’; it
shows seams, and junctures, and discrepancies; its
mass has, perhaps, been broken up and awkwardly
pieced together again; it is a building, in fact, which
has suffered extensive restoration.</p>

<p class='c015'>The further question remains as to the united
or divided authorship of these antique monuments,
regarded as separate wholes. Are they twin-productions,
or did they spring up independently,
favoured by the same prevailing climate, from a
soil similarly prepared? The answer may be left
to the dispassionate judgment of any ordinary,
uncritical reader. Supposing his mind, <i>per impossibile</i>,
a blank on the point, it would certainly not
occur to him to attribute the two poems to a single
individual. They are probably as unlike in style as,
under the circumstances, it was possible for them to
be. A great deal, indeed, belongs to them in common.
They were rooted in the same traditions;
they arose under the same sky and in the same ideal
atmosphere; the inexhaustible storehouse of their
legendary raw material was the same. Strictly analogous
conditions of politics and society are depicted
in them; they were addressed to similarly constituted
audiences; their verses were constructed on the same
rhythmical model. Moreover, the author of one was
familiar with the grand example set him by the other.
Yet the temper and spirit of each are profoundly different.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>In the Iliad, a magnificent ardour prevails;
the singer is aflame with his theme; his words glow;
vivid impressions crowd upon his mind; it takes all
the power of his genius to restrain their riotous audacity
and marshal them into orderly succession. The
author of the Odyssey, on the other hand, is in no
danger of being swept away by the impetuosity of his
thoughts. He is always collected and at leisure; he
has even <i>esprit</i>, which implies a low mental temperature;
he can stand by with a smile, and look on,
while his characters unfold themselves; his passion
never blazes; it is smouldering and sustained, like
that of his protagonist.</p>

<p class='c015'>Numerous small discrepancies, besides, seem to
betray a personal diversity of origin. So Iris, the
frequent, indeed the all but invariable messenger of
the gods in the Iliad, drops into oblivion in the Odyssey,
and is replaced by Hermes; Charis is the wife of
Hephæstus in the Iliad, Aphrodite in the Odyssey;
Neleus has twelve sons in the Iliad, three in the
Odyssey; Pylos is a district in the Iliad, a town in
the Odyssey; the oracle of the Dodonæan Zeus is
located in Thessaly in the Iliad, in Epirus in the
Odyssey, and so on.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><b>[14]</b></a> The Odyssey, moreover, is obviously
junior to the Iliad. It gives evidence of an
appreciable development of the arts of life relatively
to their state in the rival poem; the processes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>verbal contraction have advanced in the interval; the
ethical standard has become more refined; while formulaic
and other expressions common to both are
unmistakably ‘in place,’ as geologists say, in the
Iliad, ‘erratic,’ or ‘transported,’ in the Odyssey.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f14'>

<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, vol. 133.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>A difference in the place of origin, perhaps, helps
to accentuate the effect due to a difference of time.
The thread of tradition regarding these extraordinary
works is indeed hopelessly broken. Their prehistoric
existence is divided from their historical visibility by
the chasm opened when the civilisation of which they
were the choicest flowers was subverted by the irrepressible
Dorians. The Iliad, however, contains
strong internal evidence of owning Thessaly as its
native region. The vast pre-eminence of the local
hero, the Olympian seat of the gods, the partiality
displayed for the horse, intimacy with Thessalian
traditions and topography, all suggest the relationship.
The name of Thessaly, it is true, does not
occur either in the Iliad or in the Odyssey; nor had
the semi-barbarous Thessalians, when they were composed,
as yet crossed the mountains from Thesprotia
to trample down the Achæan culture of the land of
Achilles. It thus became, after Homer’s time, the
scene of a revolution analogous in every respect to
that which overwhelmed the Peloponnesus.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Homer of the Odyssey, who was not improbably
of Peloponnesian birth, must have travelled
widely. He had undeniably some personal acquaintance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>with Ithaca, his topographical indications, apart
from the gross blunder of planting the little island
west, instead of east of Cephalonia, corresponding on
the whole quite closely with reality. And he knew
something besides of most parts of the mainland of
Greece, of Crete, Delos, Chios, and the Ionian coast
of Asia Minor. The experience of the Iliadic bard
was doubtless somewhat, though not greatly, more
limited. Its range extended, at any rate, from
‘Pelasgic Argos’ to the Troad, familiarity with which
is shown in all sections of the Trojan epic. The cosmopolitan
character of both poets is only indeed what
might have been expected. The privileged members
of an Achæan community must have enjoyed wide
opportunities of observation. For Mycenæan culture
was strongly eclectic. Elements from many
quarters were amalgamated in it, Asiatic influences,
however, predominating. The men of genius who
acted as the interpreters of its typical ideas would
hence have been unfit for their task unless they had
personally tried and proved all such elements and
influences. They were presumably to some extent
adventurers by sea and land. But, further than this,
their individuality remains shrouded in the impenetrable
veil of their silence.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c010'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> Homeric ideas regarding the heavenly bodies
were of the simplest description. They stood, in fact,
very much on the same level with those entertained
by the North American Indians, when first brought
into European contact. What knowledge there was
in them was of that ‘broken’ kind which (in Bacon’s
phrase) is made up of wonder. Fragments of observation
had not even begun to be pieced in one with
the other, and so fitted, ill or well, into a whole. In
other words, there was no faintest dawning of a celestial
science.</p>

<p class='c015'>But surely, it may be urged, a poet is not bound
to be an astronomer. Why should it be assumed
that the author (or authors) of the Iliad and Odyssey
possessed information co-extensive on all points
with that of his fellow-countrymen? His profession
was not science, but song. The argument, however,
implies a reflecting backward of the present upon the
past. Among unsophisticated peoples, specialists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>unless in the matter of drugs or spells, or some few
practical processes, do not exist. The scanty stock
of gathered knowledge is held, it might be said,
in common. The property of one is the property
of all.</p>

<p class='c015'>More especially of the poet. His power over his
hearers depends upon his presenting vividly what they
already perceive dimly. It was part of the poetical
faculty of the Ithacan bard Phemius that he ‘knew
the works of gods and men.’<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><b>[15]</b></a> His special function
was to render them famous by his song. What he
had heard concerning them he repeated; adding, of
his own, the marshalling skill, the vital touch, by
which they were perpetuated. He was no inventor:
the actual life of men, with its transfiguring traditions
and baffled aspirations, was the material he had to
work with. But the life of men was very different
then from what it is now. It was lived in closer
contact with Nature; it was simpler, more typical,
consequently more susceptible of artistic treatment.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was accordingly looked at and portrayed as a
whole; and it is this very <i>wholeness</i> which is one of
the principal charms of primitive poetry—an irrecoverable
charm; for civilisation renders existence a
labyrinth of which it too often rejects the clue. In
olden times, however, its ways were comparatively
straight, and its range limited. It was accordingly
capable of being embraced with approximate entirety.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Hence the encyclopædic character of the early epics.
<i>Humani nihil alienum.</i> Whatever men thought,
and knew, and did, in that morning of the world
when they spontaneously arose, found a place in
them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now, some scheme of the heavens must always
accompany and guide human existence. There is
literally no choice for man but to observe the movements,
real or apparent, of celestial objects, and to
regulate his actions by the measure of time they mete
out to him. Nor had he at first any other means of
directing his wanderings upon the earth save by
regarding theirs in the sky. They are thus to him
standards of reference and measurement as regards
both the fundamental conditions of his being—time
and space.</p>

<p class='c015'>This intimate connexion, and, still more, the idealising
influence of the remote and populous skies, has
not been lost upon the poets in any age. It might
even be possible to construct a tolerably accurate
outline-sketch of the history of astronomy in Europe
without travelling outside the limits of their works.
But our present concern is with Homer.</p>

<p class='c015'>To begin with his mode of reckoning time. This
was by years, months, days, and hours.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><b>[16]</b></a> The week
of seven days was unknown to him; but in its place
we find<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><b>[17]</b></a> the triplicate division of the month used by
Hesiod and the later Attics, implying a month of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>thirty, and a year of 360 days, corrected, doubtless,
by some rude process of intercalation. These ten-day
intervals were perhaps borrowed at an early stage of
Achæan civilisation from Egypt, where they correspond
to the Chaldean ‘decans’—thirty-six minor
astral divinities presiding over as many sections of
the Zodiac.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><b>[18]</b></a> But no knowledge of the Signs accompanied
the transfer. A similar apportionment of
the hours of night into three watches (as amongst the
Jews before the Captivity), and of the hours of day
into three periods or stages, prevails in both the
Iliad and Odyssey. The seasons of the year, too,
were three—spring, summer, and winter—like those
of the ancient Egyptians and of our Anglo-Saxon
forefathers;<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><b>[19]</b></a> for the Homeric <i>Opora</i> was not, properly
speaking, an autumnal season, but merely an aggravation
of summer heat and drought, heralded by the
rising of Sirius towards the close of July. It, in fact,
strictly matched our ‘dog-days,’ the <i>dies caniculares</i>
of the Romans. The first direct mention of autumn
is in a treatise of the time of Alcibiades ascribed to
Hippocrates.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c017'><b>[20]</b></a> This rising of the dog-star is the only
indication in the Homeric poems of the use of a
stellar calendar such as we meet full-grown in Hesiod’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Works and Days. The same event was the harbinger
of the Nile-flood to the Egyptians, serving to
mark the opening of their year as well as to correct
the estimates of its length.</p>

<p class='c015'>The annual risings of stars had formerly, in the
absence of more accurate means of observation, an
importance they no longer possess. Mariners and
husbandmen, accustomed to watch, because at the
mercy of the heavens, could hardly fail no less to be
struck with the successive effacements by, and re-emergences
from, the solar beams, of certain well-known
stars, as the sun pursued his yearly course
amongst them, than to note the epochs of such events.
Four stages in these periodical fluctuations of visibility
were especially marked by primitive observers.
The first perceptible appearance of a star in the dawn
was known as its ‘heliacal rising.’ This brief glimpse
extended gradually as the star increased its seeming
distance from the sun, the interval of precedence in
rising lengthening by nearly four minutes each morning.
At the end of close upon six months occurred
its ‘acronycal rising,’ or last visible ascent from the
eastern horizon after sunset. Its conspicuousness
was then at the maximum, the whole of the dark
hours being available for its shining. To these two
epochs of rising succeeded and corresponded two
epochs of setting—the ‘cosmical’ and the ‘heliacal.’
A star set cosmically when, for the first time each
year, it reached the horizon long enough before break
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of day to be still distinguishable; it set heliacally
on the last evening when its rays still detached
themselves from the background of illuminated
western sky, before getting finally immersed in twilight.
The round began again when the star had
arrived sufficiently far on the other side of the sun
to show in the morning—in other words, to rise
heliacally.</p>

<p class='c015'>Wide plains and clear skies gave opportunities for
closely and continually observing these successive
moments in the revolving relations of sun and stars,
which were soon found to afford a very accurate index
to the changes of the seasons. By them, for the most
part, Hesiod’s prescriptions for navigation and agriculture
are timed; and although Homer, in conformity
with the nature of his subject, is less precise, he was
still fully aware of the association.</p>

<p class='c015'>His sun is a god—Helios—as yet unidentified with
Apollo, who wears his solar attributes unconsciously.
Helios is also known as Hyperion, ‘he who walks on
high,’ and Elector, ‘the shining one.’ Voluntarily
he pursues his daily course in the sky, and voluntarily
he sinks to rest in the ocean-stream—subject, however,
at times to a higher compulsion; for, just after
the rescue of the body of Patroclus, Heré favours her
Achæan clients by precipitating at a critical juncture
the descent of a still unwearied and unwilling luminary.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c017'><b>[21]</b></a>
On another occasion, however, Helios memorably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>asserts his independence, when, incensed at the
slaughter of his sacred cattle by the self-doomed companions
of Ulysses, he threatens to ‘descend into
Hades, and shine among the dead.’<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><b>[22]</b></a> And Zeus, in
promising the required satisfaction, virtually admits
his power to abdicate his office as illuminator of gods
and men.</p>

<p class='c015'>Once only, the solstice is alluded to in Homeric
verse. The swineherd Eumæus, in describing the
situation of his native place, the Island of Syriê, states
that it is over against Ortygia (Delos), ‘where are the
turning-places of the sun.’<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c017'><b>[23]</b></a> The phrase was probably
meant to indicate that Delos lay just so much
south of east from Ithaca as the sun lies at rising on
the shortest day of winter. But it must be confessed
that the direction was not thus very accurately laid
down, the comprised angle being 15⅓°, instead of
23½°.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c017'><b>[24]</b></a> To those early students of nature, the travelling
to and fro of the points of sunrise and sunset
furnished the most obvious clue to the yearly solar
revolution; so that an expression, to us somewhat
recondite, conveyed a direct and unmistakable meaning
to hearers whose narrow acquaintance with the
phenomena of the heavens was vivified by immediate
personal experience of them. And in point of fact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the idea in question is precisely that conveyed by the
word ‘tropic.’</p>

<p class='c015'>Selene first takes rank as a divine personage in
the pseudo-Homeric Hymns. No moon-goddess is
recognised in the Iliad or Odyssey. Nor does the
orbed ruler of ‘ambrosial night,’ regarded as a mere
light-giver or time-measurer, receive all the attention
that might have been expected. A full moon is, however,
represented with the other ‘heavenly signs’ on
the shield of Achilles, and figures somewhat superfluously
in the magnificent passage where the Trojan
watch-fires are compared to the stars in a cloudless
sky:</p>

<p class='c015'>Here, as elsewhere, the simile no sooner presents
itself than the poet’s imagination seizes upon and
develops it without overmuch regard to the illustrative
fitness of its details. The multitudinous effect of a
thousand fires blazing together on the plain inevitably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>suggested the stars. But with the stars came the
complete nocturnal scene in its profound and breathless
tranquillity. The ‘rejoicing shepherd,’ meantime,
who was part of it, would have been ill-pleased
with the darkness required for the innumerable stellar
display first thought of. And since, to the untutored
sense, landscape is delightful only so far as it gives
promise of utility, brilliant moonlight was added, for
his satisfaction and the safety of his flock, as well as
for the perfecting of that scenic beauty felt to be deficient
where human needs were left uncared for.
Just in proportion, however, as rocks, and peaks, and
wooded glens appeared distinct, the lesser lights of
heaven, and with them the fundamental idea of the
comparison, must have become effaced; and the poet,
accordingly, as if with a misgiving that the fervour of
his fancy had led him to stray from the rigid line of
his purpose, volunteered the assurance that ‘all the
stars were visible’—as, to his mind’s eye, they
doubtless were.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the ‘vivid planets’ thrown in by Pope there is
no more trace in the original, than of the ‘glowing
pole.’ Nor could there be; since Homer was totally
ignorant that such a class of bodies existed. This
curious fact affords (if it were needed) conclusive
proof of the high antiquity of the Homeric poems.
Not the faintest suspicion manifests itself in them
that Hesperus, ‘fairest of all stars set in heaven,’ is
but another aspect of Phosphorus, herald of light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>upon the earth, ‘the star that saffron-mantled Dawn
cometh after, and spreadeth over the salt sea.’<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><b>[26]</b></a> The
identification is said by Diogenes Laertius to have
been first made by Pythagoras; and it may at any
rate be assumed with some confidence that this
elementary piece of astronomical knowledge came to
the Greeks from the East, with others of a like nature,
in the course of the seventh or sixth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
Astonishing as it seems that they should not have
made the discovery for themselves, there is no evidence
that they did so. Hesiod appears equally unconscious
with Homer of the distinction between
‘fixed’ and ‘wandering’ stars. According to his
genealogical information, Phosphorus, like the rest
of the stellar multitude, sprang from the union of
Astræus with the Dawn,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><b>[27]</b></a> but no hint is given of any
generic difference between them.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is a single passage in the Iliad, and a
parallel one in the Odyssey, in which the constellations
are formally enumerated by name. Hephæstus,
we are told, made for the son of Thetis a shield great
and strong, whereon, by his exceeding skill, a multitude
of objects were figured.</p>

<p class='c015'>‘There wrought he the earth, and the heavens,
and the sea, and the unwearying sun, and the moon
waxing to the full, and the signs every one wherewith
the heavens are crowned, Pleiads, and Hyads, and
Orion’s might, and the Bear that men call also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Wain, her that turneth in her place, and watcheth

<p class='c015'>The corresponding lines in the Odyssey occur in
the course of describing the hero’s voyage from the
isle of Calypso to the land of the Phæacians. Alone,
on the raft he had constructed of Ogygian pine-wood,
he sat during seventeen days, ‘and cunningly guided
the craft with the helm; nor did sleep fall upon his
eyelids, as he viewed the Pleiads and Boötes, that
setteth late, and the Bear, which they likewise call
the Wain, which turneth ever in one place, and keepeth
watch upon Orion, and alone hath no part in the
baths of Ocean.’<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c017'><b>[29]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The sailing-directions of the goddess were to keep
the Bear always on the left—that is, to steer due
east.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is clear that one of these passages is an adaptation
from the other; nor is there reason for hesitation
in deciding which was the model. Independently of
extrinsic evidence, the verses in the Iliad have the
strong spontaneous ring of originality, while the
Odyssean lines betray excision and interpolation.
The ‘Hyads and Orion’s might’ are suppressed for
the sake of introducing Boötes. Variety was doubtless
aimed at in the change; and the conjecture is at
least a plausible one, that the added constellation
may have been known to the poet of the Odyssey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>(admitting the hypothesis of a divided authorship),
though not to the poet of the Iliad—known, that
is, in the sense that the stars comprising the figure of
the celestial Husbandman had not yet, at the time
and place of origin of the Iliad, become separated
from the anonymous throng circling in the ‘murk of
night.’</p>

<p class='c015'>The constellation Boötes—called ‘late-setting,’
probably from the perpendicular position in which it
descends below the horizon—was invented to drive
the Wain, as Arctophylax to guard the Bear, the same
group in each case going by a double name. For the
brightest of the stars thus designated we still preserve
the appellation Arcturus (from <i>arktos</i>, bear,
<i>oûros</i>, guardian), first used by Hesiod, who fixed upon
its acronycal rising, sixty days after the winter
solstice, as the signal for pruning the vines.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c017'><b>[30]</b></a> It is
not unlikely that the star received its name long
before the constellation was thought of, forming the
nucleus of a subsequently formed group. This was
undoubtedly the course of events elsewhere; the Great
and Little Dogs, for instance, the Twins, and the
Eagle (the last with two minute companions) having
been individualised as stars previous to their recognition
as asterisms.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>There is reason to believe that the stars
enumerated in the Iliad and Odyssey constituted
the whole of those known by name to the early Greeks.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>This view is strongly favoured by the identity of the
Homeric and Hesiodic stars. It is difficult to believe
that, had there been room for choice, the same list
<i>precisely</i> would have been picked out for presentation
in poems so widely diverse in scope and origin as the
Iliad and Odyssey on the one side, and the
Works and Days on the other. As regards the
polar constellations, we have positive proof that none
besides Ursa Major had been distinguished. For the
statement repeated in both the Homeric epics, that
the Bear <i>alone</i> was without part in the baths of
Ocean, implies, not that the poet veritably ignored
the unnumbered stars revolving within the circle
traced out round the pole by the seven of the Plough,
but that they still remained a nameless crowd, unassociated
with any terrestrial object, and therefore
attracting no popular observation.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Greeks, according to a well-attested tradition,
made acquaintance with the Lesser Bear through
Phœnician communication, of which Thales was the
medium. Hence the designation of the group as
<i>Phoinike</i>. Aratus (who versified the prose of Eudoxus)
has accordingly two Bears, lying (in sailors’ phrase)
‘heads and points’ on the sphere; while he expressly
states that the Greeks still (about 270 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) continued
to steer by <i>Helike</i> (the Twister, Ursa Major), while
the expert Phœnicians directed their course by the
less mobile <i>Kynosoura</i> (Ursa Minor). The absence
of any mention of a Pole-star seems at first sight surprising.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Even the Iroquois Indians directed their
wanderings from of old by the one celestial luminary
of which the position remained sensibly invariable.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c017'><b>[31]</b></a>
Yet not the gods themselves, in Homer’s time, were
aware of such a guide. It must be remembered,
however, that the axis of the earth’s rotation pointed,
2800 years ago, towards a considerably different part
of the heavens from that now met by its imaginary
prolongation. The precession of the equinoxes
has been at work in the interval, slowly but unremittingly
shifting the situation of this point among
the stars. Some 600 years before the Great Pyramid
was built, it was marked by the close vicinity
of the brightest star in the Dragon. But this in
the course of ages was left behind by the onward-travelling
pole, and further ages elapsed before the
star at the tip of the Little Bear’s tail approached
its present position. Thus the entire millennium
before the Christian era may count for an interregnum
as regards Pole-stars. Alpha Draconis had
ceased to exercise that office; Alruccabah had not yet
assumed it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The most ancient of all the constellations is
probably that which Homer distinguishes as never-setting
(it then lay much nearer to the pole than it
now does). In his time, as in ours, it went by two
appellations—the Bear and the Wain. Homer’s Bear,
however, included the same seven bright stars constituting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the Wain, and no more; whereas our Great
Bear stretches over a sky-space of which the Wain is
only a small part, three of the striding monster’s far-apart
paws being marked by the three pairs of stars
known to the Arabs as the ‘gazelle’s springs.’ How
this extension came about, we can only conjecture;
but there is evidence that it was fairly well established
when Aratus wrote his description of the constellations.
Aratus, however, copied Eudoxus, and Eudoxus
used observations made—doubtless by Accad
or Chaldean astrologers—above 2000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><b>[32]</b></a> We infer,
then, that the Babylonian Bear was no other than the
modern Ursa Major.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c017'><b>[33]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f32'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r32'>32</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>According to Mr. Proctor’s calculation. See R. Brown, <i>Eridanus:

</div>

<p class='c015'>But the primitive asterism—the Seven Rishis of
the old Hindus, the Septem Triones of the Latins,
the Arktos of Homer—included no more than seven
stars. And this is important as regards the origin of
the name. For it is impossible to suppose a likeness
to any animal suggested by the more restricted group.
Scarcely the acquiescent fancy of Polonius could find
it ‘backed like a weasel,’ or ‘very like a whale.’ Yet
a weasel or a whale would match the figure equally
well with, or better than, a bear. Probably the
growing sense of incongruity between the name and
the object it signified may have induced the attempt
to soften it down by gathering a number of additional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>stars into a group presenting a distant resemblance to
a four-legged monster.</p>

<p class='c015'>The name of the Bear, this initial difficulty notwithstanding,
is prehistoric and quasi-universal. It
was traditional amongst the American-Indian tribes,
who, however, sensible of the absurdity of attributing
a conspicuous protruding tail to an animal almost
destitute of such an appendage, turned the three
stars composing it into three pursuing hunters. No
such difficulty, however, presented itself to the
Aztecs. They recognised in the seven ‘Arctic’ stars
the image of a Scorpion,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c017'><b>[34]</b></a> and named them accordingly.
No Bear seems to have bestridden their
sky.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The same constellation figures, under a divinified
aspect, with the title <i>Otawa</i>, in the great Finnish epic,
the ‘Kalevala.’ Now, although there is no certainty
as to the original meaning of this word, which has no
longer a current application to any terrestrial object,
it is impossible not to be struck with its resemblance
to the Iroquois term <i>Okowari</i>, signifying ‘bear,’ both
zoologically and astronomically.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c017'><b>[35]</b></a> The inference seems
justified that <i>Otawa</i> held the same two meanings, and
that the Finns knew the great northern constellation
by the name of the old Teutonic king of beasts.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>It was (as we have seen) similarly designated on
the banks of the Euphrates; and a celestial she-bear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>doubtfully referred to in the Rig-Veda, becomes the
starting-point of an explanatory legend in the Râmâyana.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c017'><b>[36]</b></a>
Thus, circling the globe from the valley of
the Ganges to the great lakes of the New World, we
find ourselves confronted with the same sign in the
northern skies, the relic of some primeval association
of ideas, long since extinct.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r36'>36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gubernatis, <i>Zoological Mythology</i>, vol. ii. p. 109.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Extinct even in Homer’s time. For the myth of
Callisto (first recorded in a lost work by Hesiod) was
a subsequent invention—an effect, not a cause—a
mere embroidery of Hellenic fancy over a linguistic
fact, the true origin of which was lost in the mists of
antiquity.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is, on the other hand, no difficulty in understanding
how the Seven Stars obtained their second
title of the Wain, or Plough, or Bier. Here we have
a plain case of imitative name-giving—a suggestion
by resemblance almost as direct as that which established
in our skies a Triangle and a Northern Crown.
Curiously enough, the individual appellations still
current for the stars of the Plough, include a reminiscence
of each system of nomenclature—the legendary
and the imitative. The brightest of the seven, <i>α</i> Ursæ
Majoris, the Pointer nearest the Pole, is designated
<i>Dubhe</i>, signifying, in Arabic, ‘bear’; while the title
<i>Benetnasch</i>—equivalent to <i>Benât-en-Nasch</i>, ‘daughters
of the bier’—of the furthest star in the plough-handle,
perpetuates the lugubrious fancy, native in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Arabia, by which the group figures as a corpse attended
by three mourners.</p>

<p class='c015'>Turning to the second great constellation mentioned
in both Homeric epics, we again meet traces of
remote and unconscious tradition: yet less remote,
probably, than that concerned with the Bear—certainly
less inscrutable; for recent inquiries into the
lore and language of ancient Babylon have thrown
much light on the relationships of the Orion fable.</p>

<p class='c015'>There seems no reason to question the validity of
Mr. Robert Brown’s interpretation of the word by the
Accadian <i>Ur-ana</i>, ‘light of heaven.’<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c017'><b>[37]</b></a> But a proper
name is significant only where it originates. Moreover,
it is considered certain that the same brilliant
star-group known to Homer no less than to us as
Orion, was termed by Chaldeo-Assyrian peoples
‘Tammuz,’<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c017'><b>[38]</b></a> a synonym of Adonis. Nor is it difficult
to divine how the association came to be established.
For, about 2000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, when the Euphratean constellations
assumed their definitive forms, the belt of
Orion began to be visible before dawn in the month
of June, called ‘Tammuz,’ because the death of
Adonis was then celebrated. It is even conceivable
that the heliacal rising of the asterism may originally
have given the signal for that celebration. We
can at any rate scarcely doubt that it received the
name of ‘Tammuz’ because its annual emergence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>from the solar beams coincided with the period of
mystical mourning for the vernal sun.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Orion, too, has solar connexions. In the Fifth
Odyssey (121-24), Calypso relates to Hermes how the
love for him of Aurora excited the jealousy of the
gods, extinguished only when he fell a victim to it,
slain by the shafts of Artemis in Ortygia. Obviously,
a sun-and-dawn myth slightly modified from the common
type. The post-Homeric stories, too, of his
relations with Œnopion of Chios, and of his death by
the bite of a scorpion (emblematical of darkness, like
the boar’s tusk in the Adonis legend), confirm his
position as a luminous hero.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c017'><b>[39]</b></a> Altogether, the evidence
is strongly in favour of considering Orion as a variant
of Adonis, imported into Greece from the East at an
early date, and there associated with the identical
group of stars which commemorated to the Accads of
old the fate of Dumuzi (<i>i.e.</i> Tammuz), the ‘Only Son
of Heaven.’</p>

Myth</i>, chap. x. § v.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It is remarkable that Homer knows nothing of
stellar mythology. He nowhere attempts to account
for the names of the stars. He has no stories at his
fingers’ ends of translations to the sky as a ready
means of exit from terrestrial difficulties. The Orion
of his acquaintance—the beloved of the Dawn, the
mighty hunter, surpassing in beauty of person even
the divinely-born Aloidæ—died and descended to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Hades like other mortals, and was there seen by
Ulysses, a gigantic shadow ‘driving the wild beasts
together over the mead of asphodel, the very beasts
which he himself had slain on the lonely hills, with
a strong mace all of bronze in his hand, that is
ever unbroken.’<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c017'><b>[40]</b></a> His stellar connexion is treated as
a fact apart. The poet does not appear to feel any
need of bringing it into harmony with the Odyssean
vision.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f40'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The brightest star in the heavens is termed by
Homer the ‘dog of Orion.’ The name <i>Seirios</i> (significant
of sparkling), makes its <i>début</i> in the verses of
Hesiod. To the singer of the Iliad the dog-star is
a sign of fear, its rising giving presage to ‘wretched
mortals’ of the intolerable, feverish blaze of late
summer (<i>opora</i>). The deadly gleam of its rays hence
served the more appropriately to exemplify the lustre
of havoc-dealing weapons. Diomed, Hector, Achilles,
‘all furnish’d, all in arms,’ are compared in turn, by
way of prelude to an ‘<i>aristeia</i>,’ or culminating epoch
of distinction in battle, to the same brilliant but baleful
object. Glimmering fitfully across clouds, it not
inaptly typifies the evanescent light of the Trojan
hero’s fortunes, no less than the flashing of his
armour, as he moves restlessly to and fro.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c017'><b>[41]</b></a> Of Achilles
it is said:</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Him the old man Priam first beheld, as he sped across the
plain, blazing as the star that cometh forth at harvest-time, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>plain seen his rays shine forth amid the host of stars in the
darkness of night, the star whose name men call Orion’s Dog.
Brightest of all is he, yet for an evil sign is he set, and bringeth
much fever upon hapless men. Even so on Achilles’ breast the
bronze gleamed as he ran.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c017'><b>[42]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>In the corresponding passage relating to Diomed
(v. 4-7), the <i>naïve</i> literalness with which the ‘baths
of Ocean’ are thought of is conveyed by the hint
that the star shone at rising with increased brilliancy
through having newly washed in them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Abnormal celestial appearances are scarcely noticed
in the Homeric poems. Certain portentous darknesses,
reinforcing the solemnity of crises of battle, or impending
doom,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c017'><b>[43]</b></a> are much too vaguely defined to be
treated as indexes to natural phenomena of any kind.
Nevertheless, Professor Stockwell finds that, by a
curious coincidence, Ajax’s Prayer to Father Zeus for
death—if death was decreed—in the light, might very
well have been uttered during a total eclipse of the
sun, the lunar shadow having passed centrally over
the Hellespont at 2h. 21 min. <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on August 28, 1184
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c017'><b>[44]</b></a> Comets, however, have left not even the suspicion
of a trace in these early songs; nor do they embody
any tradition of a star shower, or of a display
of Northern Lights. The rain of blood, by which
Zeus presaged and celebrated the death of Sarpedon,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c017'><b>[45]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>might, it is true, be thought to embody a reminiscence
of a crimson aurora, frequently, in early times, chronicled
under that form; but the portent indicated is
more probably an actual shower of rain tinged red by
a microscopic alga. An unmistakable meteor, however,
furnishes one of the glowing similes of the
Iliad. By its help the irresistible swiftness and unexpectedness
of Athene’s descent from Olympus to
the Scamandrian plain are illustrated.</p>

<p class='c015'>The point of most significance about Homer’s
scanty astronomical notions is that they were of home
growth. They are precisely such as would arise
among a people in an incipient stage of civilisation,
simple, direct, and childlike in their mode of regarding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>natural phenomena, yet incapable of founding
upon them any close or connected reasoning. Of
Oriental mysticism there is not a vestige. No occult
influences rain from the sky. Not so much as a
square inch of foundation is laid for the astrological
superstructure. It is true that Sirius is a ‘baleful
star’; but it is in the sense of being a harbinger of
hot weather. Possibly, or probably, it is regarded
as a concomitant cause, no less than as a sign of
the August droughts; indeed the <i>post hoc</i> and the
<i>propter hoc</i> were, in those ages, not easily separable;
the effect, however, in any case, was purely
physical, and so unfit to become the starting-point of
a superstition.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Homeric names of the stars, too, betray common
reminiscences rather than foreign intercourse.
They are all either native, or naturalised on Greek
soil. The transplanted fable of Orion has taken root
and flourished there. The cosmopolitan Bear is
known by her familiar Greek name. Boötes is a
Greek husbandman, variously identified with Arcas,
son of Callisto, or with Icarus, the luckless mandatory
of Dionysus. The Pleiades and the Hyades are
intelligibly designated in Greek. The former word is
usually derived from <i>pleîn</i>, to sail; the heliacal rising
of the ‘tangled’ stars in the middle of May having
served, from the time of Hesiod, to mark the opening
of the season safe for navigation, and their cosmical
setting, at the end of October, its close. But this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>etymology was most likely an after-thought. Long
before rules for navigating the Ægean came to be
formulated, the ‘sailing-stars’ must have been designated
by name amongst the Achæan tribes. Besides,
Homer is ignorant of any such association. Now in
Arabic the Pleiades are called <i>Eth Thuraiyâ</i>, from
<i>therwa</i>, copious, abundant. The meaning conveyed is
that of many gathered into a small space; and it is
quite similar to that of the Biblical <i>kîmah</i>, a near
connexion of the Assyrian <i>kimtu</i>, family.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c017'><b>[48]</b></a> Analogy,
then, almost irresistibly points to the interpretation
of Pleiades by the Greek <i>pleiones</i>, many, or <i>pleîos</i>,
full; giving to the term, in either case, the obvious
signification of a ‘cluster.’</p>

Language</i>, p. 69.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Of the Hyades, similarly, the ‘rainy’ association
seems somewhat far-fetched. They rise and set respectively
about four days later than the Pleiades; so
that, as prognostics of the seasons, it would be difficult
to draw a permanent distinction between the two
groups; yet one was traditionally held to bring fair,
the other foul weather. There can be little doubt
that an etymological confusion lay at the bottom of
this inconsistency. ‘To rain,’ in Greek is <i>huein</i>; but
<i>hus</i> (cognate with ‘sow’) means a ‘pig.’ Moreover,
in old Latin, the Hyades were called <i>Suculæ</i> (‘little
pigs’); although the misapprehension which he supposed
to be betrayed by the term was rebuked by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Cicero.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c017'><b>[49]</b></a> Possibly the misapprehension was the other
way. It is quite likely that ‘Suculæ’ preserved the
original meaning of ‘Hyades,’ and that the pluvious
derivation was invented at a later time, when the
conception of the seven stars in the head of the Bull
as a ‘litter of pigs’ had come to appear incongruous
and inelegant. It has, nevertheless, just that character
of <i>naïveté</i> which stamps it as authentic. Witness
the popular names of the sister-group—the widely-diffused
‘hen and chickens,’ Sancho Panza’s ‘las
siete cabrillas,’ met and discoursed with during
his famous aërial voyage on the back of Clavileño,
the Sicilian ‘seven dovelets,’—all designating the
Pleiades. Still more to the purpose is the Anglo-Saxon
‘boar-throng,’ which, by a haphazard identification,
has been translated as Orion, but which
Grimm, on better grounds, suggests may really apply
to the Hyades.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c017'><b>[50]</b></a> It is scarcely credible that any other
constellation can be indicated by a term so manifestly
reproducing the ‘Suculæ’ of Latin and Sabine
husbandmen.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Homeric scheme of the heavens, then (such
as it is), was produced at home. No stellar lore had
as yet been imported from abroad. An original community
of ideas is just traceable in the names of some
of the stars; that is all. The epoch of instruction by
more learned neighbours was still to come. The Signs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>of the Zodiac were certainly unknown to Homer, yet
their shining array had been marshalled from the
banks of the Euphrates at least 2000 years before
the commencement of the Christian era. Their introduction
into Greece is attributed to Cleostratus of
Tenedos, near, or shortly after, the end of the sixth
century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> By that time, too, acquaintance had
been made with the ‘Phœnician’ constellation of the
Lesser Bear, and with the wanderings of the planets.
Astronomical communications, in fact, began to pour
into Hellas from Egypt, Babylonia, and Phœnicia
about the seventh century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Now, if there were
any reasonable doubt that ‘blind Melesigenes’ lived
at a period anterior to this, it would be removed by
the consideration of what he lets fall about the
heavenly bodies. For, though he might have ignored
formal astronomy, he could not have remained unconscious
of such striking and popular facts as the
identity of Hesperus and Phosphorus, the Sidonian
pilots’ direction of their course by the ‘Cynosure,’ or
the mapping-out of the sun’s path among the stars
by a series of luminous figures of beasts and men.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus the hypothesis of a late origin for the Iliad
and Odyssey is negatived by the astronomical ignorance
betrayed in them. It has, however, gradations;
whence some hints as to the relative age of the two
epics may be derived. The differences between them
in this respect are, it is true, small, and they both
stand approximately on the same astronomical level
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>with the poems of Hesiod. Yet an attentive study of
what they have to tell us about the stars affords some
grounds for placing the Iliad, the Odyssey, and
the Works and Days in a descending series as to
time.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the first place, the division of the month into
three periods of ten days each is unknown in the
Iliad, is barely hinted at in the Odyssey, but is
brought into detailed notice in the Hesiodic calendar.
Further, the ‘turning-points of the sun’ are unmentioned
in the Iliad, but serve in the Odyssey, by
their position on the horizon, to indicate direction;
while the winter solstice figures as a well-marked
epoch in the Works and Days. Hesiod, moreover,
designates the dog-star (not expressly mentioned in
the Odyssey) by a name of which the author of the
Iliad was certainly ignorant. Besides which an
additional constellation (Boötes) to those named in
the Iliad appears in the Odyssey and the Works
and Days; while the title ‘Hyperion,’ applied substantively
to the sun in the Odyssey, is used only
adjectivally in the Iliad. Finally, stellar mythology
begins with Hesiod; Homer (whether the Iliadic or
the Odyssean) takes the names of the stars as he finds
them, without seeking to connect them with any sublunary
occurrences.</p>

<p class='c015'>To be sure, differences of place and purpose might
account for some of these discrepancies, yet their
cumulative effect in fixing relative epochs is considerable;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>and, even apart from chronology, it is something
to look towards the skies with the ‘most high
poet,’ and to retrace, with the aid of our own better
knowledge, the simple meanings their glorious aspect
held for him.</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c010'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />THE DOG IN HOMER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Two</span> sets of strongly contrasted, nay, one might beforehand
have thought mutually exclusive qualities,
go to make up the canine character. In all ages, and
amongst all nations, the dog has become a byword for
its uncleanly habits, disgusting voracity, its quarrelsome
and aggressive selfishness. The cynic, or ‘dog-like’
philosopher, is a type of what is unamiable in
human nature. Growling, snarling, whining, barking,
snapping and biting, crouching and fawning, constitute
a vocabulary descriptive of canine deportment
conveying none but repulsive and odious associations.
Our language pursues the animal through its different
varieties and stages of existence in order to find
varying epithets of contumely and reproach. The
universal and almost prehistoric term of abuse formed
by the simple patronymic—so to speak—has lost little
of its pristine favour, and none of its pristine force;
while amongst ourselves ‘hound,’ ‘puppy,’ ‘cur,’
‘whelp,’ and ‘cub,’ come in as harmonics of the
fundamental note of insult.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>On the other hand, some millenniums of experience
have constituted the dog a type of incorruptible
fidelity, patient abnegation, devoted attachment reaching
unto and beyond the grave. Many animals have
been made the slaves and victims of man; some have
been found capable of becoming his willing allies;
none, save the dog, affords to his master a true and
intelligent companionship. Other members of the
brute creation are subdued by domestication; the
dog is, it might be said, transfigured by it. A new
nature awakes in him. A higher ideal presents itself
to him. His dormant affections are kindled; his
latent intelligence develops. The overwhelming
fascination of humanity submerges his native ignoble
instincts, evokes virtues which man himself admires
rather than practises, engages a pathetic confidence,
inspires an indomitable love. Literature teems with
instances of canine constancy and self-devotion. The
long life-in-death of ‘Grey Friars Bobby’ forms no
prodigy in the history of his race. From the dog of
Colophon to the dog of Bairnsdale, man’s four-footed
friend has been found capable of the supreme sacrifice
which one living creature can make for another.
Even in the dim dawnings of civilisation this animal
was chosen as the symbol of watchful attendance and
untiring subordination. The bright star Sirius, owing
to its close waiting on the ‘giant’ of the skies, was
from the earliest time known as the ‘dog of Orion.’
A brace of hounds typified to the ardent imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of the Vedic poets the inseparable association with the
sun of the morning and evening twilight. Æschylus
elevates and enlarges the idea of divine companionship
in the eagle by calling it the ‘winged dog of
Zeus.’<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c017'><b>[51]</b></a> Clytemnestra, in her hypocritical protestations
before the elders of Argos, could find no more
striking image of fidelity than that of a house-dog left
by its master to guard his hearth and possessions.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c017'><b>[52]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f51'>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r52'>52</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Agamemnon</i>, 520.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Two opposing currents of sentiment regarding the
animal have thus from the first set strongly in—one
of repulsion verging towards abhorrence, the other
of sympathy touched by the yearning pity which a
superior being cannot choose but feel towards an
inferior laying at his feet the priceless gift of love.
But since his higher qualities develop, as it would
seem, exclusively under the stimulation of human
influence, it might have been anticipated, and it is
actually the case, that in those countries where the
dog is neglected, he is also despised, as by an inevitable
reaction it must follow that where he is
despised, he will also be neglected. It is accordingly
among peoples whose pursuits repel his co-operation
that the sinister view prevails, while in hunting and
pastoral regions his credit grows as his faculties are
cultivated, and from the minister and delegate, he
creeps by insensible gradations into the place of
canine beatitude as the friend of man. The attitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of repulsion is, as is well known, general amongst
Mahometan populations, and may be described—although
with notable exceptions, such as of the
ancient Egyptians and Assyrians, the modern Parsees
and Japanese—as the Oriental position towards the
species; while a benevolent sentiment is, on the
whole, characteristic of Western nations.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now each of these opposite views is strongly and
characteristically represented in the Homeric poems;
represented not as the mere reflection of a popular
instinct, but with a certain ardour of personal feeling
which now and again seems for a moment to draw
back the veil of epic impersonality from before the
living face of the poet. To the bigoted believers in
an indivisible Homer the fact is, no doubt, of most
perplexing import, and we leave them to account for
it as best they may; but to impartial inquirers it
affords at once a clue and an illumination. For the
Epic of Troy is not more sharply characterised by
canine antipathy than the Song of Ulysses by canine
sympathy; while, to enhance the contrast, dislike
to the dog is most remarkably associated with a vivid
and untiring enthusiasm for the horse; and deep
feeling for the dog with comparative indifference to
the equine race. More effectually than the most
elaborate arguments of the Separatists, this innate
disparity of sentiment appears to shiver the long contested
unity of Homeric authorship.</p>

<p class='c015'>To descend, however, to particulars. Homeric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>dogs may be divided into four categories. (1) Dogs
used in the chace; (2) shepherds’ dogs; (3) watch-dogs
and house-dogs; (4) scavenger dogs. In the Iliad, the
first two classes occur incidentally only, either by way
of illustration or in the course of some episodical
narrative, such as that of the Calydonian boar-hunt
in the Ninth Book. The plastic circumference of the
Shield of Achilles includes a cameo of dog-life; but it
is noticeable that the position there assigned to the
animal is of a somewhat ignominious character, and
is indicated with a perceptible touch of contempt.
The scene is depicted in the following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>It can scarcely be maintained that a lover of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>species would have selected the incident for typical
representation in his great world-picture.</p>

<p class='c015'>The direct Iliadic references to dogs, on the other
hand, show clearly that they were domesticated in
Troy, that they lived in the tents of the Achæan chiefs,
(probably with a guarding office), and that they
roamed the camp, devouring offal, and hideously contending
with vultures and other feathered rivals for
the human remains left unburied on the field of
battle. The circumstance that in this revolting capacity
they were predominantly present to the mind of
the poet unveils the secret of his profound aversion.
Not as the humble and faithful minister of man,
hearkening to his voice, hanging on his looks, holding
his life at a pin’s fee in comparison with his service,
the author of the Iliad conceived of the dog; but as a
filthy and bloodthirsty beast of prey, the foul outrager
of the sanctities of death, the ravenous and undiscriminating
violator of the precious casket of the
human soul. In the tragic appeal of Priam to Hector
as he awaits the onslaught of Achilles beneath the
walls of Troy, this aversion touches its darkest depth,
and obtains an almost savage completeness of expression.
Anticipating the imminent catastrophe of his
house and kingdom, the despairing old man thus
portrays his own approaching doom—</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Is it credible that the same mind which was
capable of conjuring up this abhorrent vision should
have conceived the pathetic picture of the faithful
hound in the Odyssey? Nor can there be found, in
the wide range of the great Ilian epic, a single passage
inconsistent in spirit with the lines cited above.
Throughout its cantos, in which the usefulness of the
animal is nevertheless amply recognised, and his
peculiarities sketched with graphic power and truthfulness,
runs, like a dark thread, the remembrance of
his hateful office as the inflictor of the last and most
atrocious insult upon ‘miserable humanity.’<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c017'><b>[55]</b></a> One
of the leading ‘motives’ of the poem is, indeed, the
fate of the body after death. The overmastering importance
attached to its honourable interment forms
the hinge upon which a considerable portion of the
action turns. The dread of its desecration continually
haunts the imagination of the poet, and broods
alike over the ramparts of Ilium and the tents of
Greece. From the first lines almost to the last the
loathsome processes of canine sepulture stand out as
the direst result of defeat—the crowning terror of
death. Among the disastrous effects of the wrath of
Achilles foreshadowed in the opening invocation, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>visible and tangible horror is afforded by ‘devouring
dogs and hungry vultures’ exercising their revolting
function on the corpses of the slain; before the dying
eyes of Hector rises, like a nightmare, the horrible
anticipation of becoming the prey of ‘Achæan hounds,’<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c017'><b>[56]</b></a>
while his fierce adversary refuses to impair the gloomy
perfection of his vengeance by remitting that supreme
penalty;<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c017'><b>[57]</b></a> next to the honours of his funeral-pyre,
the chiefest consolation offered to the Shade of Patroclus
is the promise to make the body of his slayer
food for curs;<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c017'><b>[58]</b></a> in her despair, Hecuba shrieks that
she brought forth her son to ‘glut swift-footed dogs,’<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c017'><b>[59]</b></a>
and bids Priam not seek to avert the abhorred doom.
These instances, which it would be easy to multiply,
are unmodified by a solitary expression of tenderness
towards canine nature, or a single example of canine
affection towards man.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>It is true that a different view has been advocated
by Sir William Geddes, who, in his valuable work,
‘The Problem of the Homeric Poems,’ first dwelt in
detail on the contrasted treatment of the horse and
dog in those early epics. He did not, however, stop
there. A theory, designed to solve the secular puzzle
of Homeric authorship, had presented itself to him,
and demanded for its support a somewhat complex
marshalling of facts. His contention was briefly
this:—that the Odyssey, with the ten books of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Iliad<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c017'><b>[60]</b></a> amputated by Mr. Grote’s critical knife from
the trunk of a supposed primitive Achilleid, are the
work of one and the same author, an Ionian of Asia
Minor, to whom the venerable name of Homer properly
belongs; while the fourteen books constituting
the nucleus and main substance of our Iliad are
abandoned to an unknown Thessalian bard. He has
not, indeed, succeeded in engaging on his side the
general opinion of the learned, yet it cannot be denied
that his ingenious and patient analysis of the Homeric
texts has served to develop some highly suggestive
minor points. The validity of his main argument
obviously depends, in the first place, upon the discovery
of striking correspondences between the
Odyssey and the non-Achillean cantos of the Iliad;
in the second, upon the exposure of irreconcilable discrepancies
between the Odyssey and the Grotean
Achilleid. But the attempt is really hopeless to
transplant the canine sympathy manifest in the
Odyssey to any part of the Iliad, or to localise in
any particular section of the Iliad the equine sympathies
displayed throughout the many-coloured tissue
of its composition.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f60'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r60'>60</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These are Books ii. to vii. inclusive, ix. x. xxiii. and xxiv. The
<i>Achilleid</i> thus consists of Books i. viii. and xi.-xxii.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Everywhere alike enthusiasm for the horse is
evoked, vividly and spontaneously, on all suitable
occasions. Ardent admiration is uniformly bestowed
upon his powers and faculties. He is nowhere passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>by with indifference. The verses glow with a kind of
rapture of enjoyment that describe his strength and
beauty, his eager spirit and fine nervous organisation,
his intelligent and disinterested participation in human
struggles and triumphs. In the region of the Iliad
claimed for the Odyssean Homer, it suffices to point
to the episode of the capture by Diomed and Sthenelus
of the divinely-descended steeds of Æneas;<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c017'><b>[61]</b></a> to
the careful provision of ambrosial forage for the
horses of Heré along the shores of Simoeis;<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c017'><b>[62]</b></a> to the
resplendent simile of Book vi.;<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c017'><b>[63]</b></a> to the gleeful zeal
with which Odysseus and Diomed secure, as the fruit
and crown of their nocturnal expedition, the milk-white
coursers of Rhesus;<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c017'><b>[64]</b></a> to the living fervour imported
into the chariot-race at the funeral games of
Patroclus; to the tender pathos with which Achilles
describes the grief of his immortal horses for their
well-loved charioteer.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c017'><b>[65]</b></a> The enumeration of similar
examples from non-Achillean cantos might be carried
much further, but where is the use of ‘breaking in an
open door’? The evidence is overwhelming as to
homogeneity of sentiment, in this important respect,
through the entire Iliad. If more than one author
was concerned in its production, the coadjutors were
at least unanimous in their glowing admiration for
the heroic animal of battle.</p>

indications of a sympathetic feeling towards the dog
consonant to that displayed in the Odyssey, be pronounced
successful. Certainly much stress cannot be

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r66'>66</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The number <i>nine</i> is curiously associated with the canine species.
The herdsmen’s pack on the Shield of Achilles consists of <i>nine</i>;

(<i>Dogs: their Origin and Varieties</i>, p. 37), that Fingal kept <i>nine</i>

<p class='c015'>These sanguinary rites have been thought to
afford proof that canine companionship was necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to the happiness of a Greek hero in the other world.
For, amongst rude peoples, from the Scythians of
Herodotus<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c017'><b>[68]</b></a> to the Indians of Patagonia, such sacrifices
have been a common mode of testifying respect
to the dead. And it may readily be admitted that
their originally inspiring idea was that of continued
association after death with the objects most valued
in life. But such an idea appears to have been very
remotely, if at all, present to the mind of our
poet. The Ghost of Patroclus, at any rate, though
sufficiently communicative, expresses no desire for
canine, equine, bovine, or ovine society, although
specimens of all four species were immolated in its
honour. The purpose of Achilles in instituting the
ghastly solemnity was, as he himself expressed it,</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f68'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>But the motives that crowded upon his fierce soul
were probably in truth as multitudinous as the waves
of passion which rolled over it. He desired to appease
the parted spirit of his friend with a sacrifice matching
his own pride and the extent of his bereavement.
Still more, he sought to glut his vengeance, and allay,
if possible, the intolerable pangs of his grief. He
perhaps dimly imaged to himself a pompous funeral
throng accompanying the beloved soul even to the
gates of Hades, provision for the way being supplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>by the flesh of sheep and oxen, an escort by horses
and dogs, while an air of gloomy triumph was imparted
to the shadowy procession by the hostile
presence of outraged and indignant human shades. A
similar ceremony was put in practice, by comparison
recently, in Lithuania. When the still pagan Grand
Duke Gedimin died in 1341, his body was laid on
a pyre and burned with two hounds, two falcons,
his horse saddled and still living, and a favourite
servant.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c017'><b>[70]</b></a> But here the disembodied company was
altogether friendly, and may have been thought of
as willingly paying a last tribute of homage to their
lord.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The information is in any case worth having that
Patroclus, like Priam, kept a number of ‘table-dogs,’
whose presence doubtless contributed in some degree
to the stateliness of his surroundings. It is, however,
given casually, without a word of comment, as if the
bard instinctively shrank from dwelling on the intimate
personal relations of the animal to man. The
son of Menœtius had a gentle soul, and we cannot
doubt, although no hint of such affection is communicated,
that he loved his dogs, and was loved by them.
Of the horses accustomed to his guidance—the immortal
pair of Achilles—we indeed hear how they
stood, day after day, with drooping heads and silken
manes sweeping the ground, in sorrow for his and
their lost friend; but no dog is permitted to whine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>his sense of bereavement beside the body of Patroclus;
no dog misses the vanished caress of his master’s
hand; no dog crouches beside Achilles in his solitude,
or offers to his unsurpassed grief the dumb and
wistful consolation of his sympathy. The privilege
of sharing the sorrows, as of winning the applause of
humanity, is, in the Iliad, reserved exclusively for the
equine race.</p>

<p class='c015'>Turning to the Odyssey, we find ourselves in a
changed world. Ships have here become the ‘chariots
of the sea’;<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c017'><b>[71]</b></a> navigation usurps the honour and interest
of charioteering; a favourable breeze imparts
the cheering sense of companionship felt by a practised
rider with his trusty steed. The scenery on shore
leaves this sentiment undisturbed. Rocky Ithaca,
Telemachus informs Menelaus,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c017'><b>[72]</b></a> contains neither wide
tracks for chariot-driving, nor deep meadows for
horse-pasture; it is a goat-feeding land, though more
beautiful, to his mind, in its ruggedness than even
the ‘spacious plain’ of Sparta, with its rich fields
of lotus-grass, its sedgy flats, its waving tracts of
‘white barley,’ wheat, and spelt. A suitable habitat
is thus, in his native island, wanting for the horse,
who is accordingly relegated to an obscure corner
of the stage, while the foreground of animal life is
occupied by his less imposing rival in the regard of
man. The dog is, in fact, the characteristic and conspicuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>animal of the Odyssey, as the horse is of the
Iliad. Xanthus and Balius, the wind-begotten steeds
bestowed by Poseidon upon the sire of Achilles, who
own the sorrowful human gift of tears, and the superhuman
gift of prophetic speech, are replaced<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c017'><b>[73]</b></a> by the
more homely, but not less pathetic, figure of Argus,
the dog of Odysseus, whose fidelity through a score of
years we feel to be no poetical fiction, but simply a
poetical enhancement of a familiar fact. Canine
society is, indeed, placed by the author of the Odyssey
on a higher level than it occupies, perhaps, in any
other work of the imagination. When Telemachus,
starting into sudden manhood under the tutelage of
Athene, goes forth to lay his wrongs before the first
Assembly convened in Ithaca since his father’s ‘hollow
ships’ sailed for Troy, we are told that he carried in
his hand a brazen spear, and that the goddess poured
out upon him a divine radiance of beauty such that
the people marvelled as they gazed on him. But the
most singular and significant part of the description
lies in the statement (thrice repeated on similar
occasions<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c017'><b>[74]</b></a>) that he went ‘not alone; two swift-footed
dogs followed him.’ Alone indeed he was, as far as
human companionship was concerned—a helpless
youth, isolated and indignant in the midst of a riotous
and overbearing crew, intent not less upon wasting
his substance than upon wooing his unwidowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>mother. Comrade or attendant he had none, but
instead of both, a pair of four-footed sympathisers,
evidently regarded as adding dignity to his appearance
in public, as well as imparting the strengthening
consciousness of social support. The conjunction, as
Mr. Mahaffy well remarks, shows an intense appreciation
of dog-nature.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the cottage of Eumæus the swineherd, Odysseus,
disguised as a beggar, weary with long wanderings, a
stranger in peril of his life in his own islet-kingdom,
finds his first hospitable refuge. Here again we are
met by graphic and frequent sketches of canine
manners and character. In the office of guarding
and governing the 960 porkers composing his herd,
Eumæus had the aid of four dogs reared by himself.
They were large and fierce, ‘like wild beasts’;<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c017'><b>[75]</b></a> but
the savage instincts even of these half-reclaimed
creatures are discovered to be directed towards duty,
to be subdued by affection, nay, to be elevated by a
touch of supersensual awe. If they erred, it was by
excess of zeal in the cause of law and order. For
when Odysseus (it must be remembered, in extremely
disreputable guise) approached the thorn-hedged enclosure,
they set upon him together, barking furiously,
and threatening to tear him to pieces on the spot.
He had not, however, edged his way between Scylla
and Charybdis to perish thus ingloriously. With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>unfailing presence of mind he instantly took up an
attitude of non-resistance, stood still and laid aside
his staff. This passivity doubtless produced some
hesitation on the part of his assailants, for when the
swineherd hurried out to the rescue, he was still unhurt.
No small amount of compulsion, both moral
and physical—exerted by means of objurgatory remonstrance,
coupled with plentiful stone-pelting—was,
however, required to calm the ardour of such
impetuous allies.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f75'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Nevertheless, their ferocity is represented as far
from undiscriminating. It is, in fact, strictly limited
by their official responsibilities. They know how to
suit their address to their company, from an Olympian
denizen to a homeless tramp, and get unexpected
opportunities of displaying these social accomplishments.
For the rustic dwelling of Eumæus becomes
a rendezvous for the principal personages of the
story, and the demeanour of the four dogs is a leading
incident, carefully recorded, connected with the
arrival of each. We have just seen what an obstreperous
reception they gave to the disguised king of
Ithaca. Telemachus, on the other hand, they rushed
to welcome, fawning and wagging their tails <i>without
barking</i>,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c017'><b>[76]</b></a> as that quick-witted vagrant, whose arrival
had preceded his, was the first to observe. But
when Athene visited the farm for the purpose of
bringing about the recognition of the father by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>son, which was the first step towards retribution
upon their common enemies, while Telemachus remained
unconscious of her presence—’for not to all
do the gods manifest themselves openly’—it is said,
with a very remarkable coupling of man and beast,
that ‘Odysseus and the dogs saw her’;<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c017'><b>[77]</b></a> and the
mysterious sense of the supernatural attributed in
much folk-lore to the canine species found vent in
whimperings of fear and panic-stricken withdrawal.</p>

<p class='c015'>We are next transported to the scene of the revellings
of the Suitors, and the fortitude of Penelope.
The sight of the once familiar turreted enclosure of
his palace, and the sound of the well-remembered
voice and lyre of the minstrel Phemius, proclaiming
the progress of the festivities, all but overturned the
equanimity of the counterfeit mendicant. His practised
powers of dissimulation, however, came to his
aid; and grasping the hand of his unsuspecting retainer,
he brought, with a cunningly devised speech,
his tell-tale emotion into harmony with his assumed
character. They advanced to the threshold, and there,
on a dung-heap, half devoured with insect parasites,
lay a dog—the dog Argus. But we must allow the
poet to tell the story in his own way.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thus as they spake, a dog that lay apart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lifted his head, and pricked his list’ning ears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Argus, whom erst Odysseus patient bred,</div>
      <div class='line'>But use of him had none; for ere that day,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>He sailed for sacred Troy; and other men</div>
      <div class='line'>Had trained and led him forth o’er field and fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>To chase wild goats, hares, and the pricket deer.</div>
      <div class='line'>But now, his master gone, in foul neglect,</div>
      <div class='line'>On dung of ox and mule he made his couch;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fattening manure, heaped at the palace-gate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till spread to enrich Odysseus’ wide domain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus stretched, with vermin swarming, Argus lay.</div>
      <div class='line'>But when he saw Odysseus close approach,</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew, and wagged his tail, and dropped his ears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet could not rise to fawn upon his lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who paused, and stood, and brushed aside a tear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hiding his grief. Then thus with crafty speech:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Eumæus, sure ‘tis wonder in such plight</div>
      <div class='line'>To see this dog, of goodly form and limbs;</div>
      <div class='line'>But tell me did his fleetness match his shape,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or was he such as, reared for pride and show,</div>
      <div class='line'>Inactive at their masters’ tables feed?’</div>
      <div class='line'>Eumæus heard, and quickly made reply:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘To one who perished in a distant land</div>
      <div class='line'>This dog belongs. But couldst thou see him now</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as Odysseus left him, bound for Troy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou well might’st wonder at his strength and speed.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Mid the deep thickets of the forest glades,</div>
      <div class='line'>No game escaped his swift pursuing feet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor hound could match his prowess in the chace.</div>
      <div class='line'>But now his days are evil, since his lord</div>
      <div class='line'>Is dead, and careless women heed him not.</div>
      <div class='line'>For when the master’s hand no longer rules,</div>
      <div class='line'>Servants no longer work in order due.</div>
      <div class='line'>Full half the virtue leaves the man condemned</div>
      <div class='line'>By wide-eyed Zeus to drag the servile chain.’</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus as he spake, he crossed the stately hall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And took his place amidst the suitors’ train.</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Surely—even thus inadequately rendered—the
most poignantly pathetic narrative of dog-life in
literature! The hero, returning after a generation
of absence, in a disguise impenetrable to son, servants,
nay to the wife of his bosom, is recognised by
one solitary living creature, a dog. And to this
faithful animal, unforgetting in his forlorn decrepitude,
whose affectionate gestures form his only welcome
to the home now occupied by unscrupulous
foes, ready to take his life at the first hint of his
identity, he is obliged to refuse a stroke of his hand,
or so much as a glance of his eye, to soothe the fatal
spasm of his joy. A case that might well draw a
tear, even from the much-enduring son of Laertes.</p>

<p class='c015'>It has not escaped the acumen of Sir William
Geddes<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c017'><b>[79]</b></a> that the compliment of an individual name
is, in the Iliad, paid exclusively amongst the brute
creation to horses; in the Odyssey (setting aside the
mythical coursers of the Dawn, Book xxiii. 246) to a
single dog. Now this may at first sight seem to be a
trifling point; but a very little consideration will
suffice to show its significance. To the author of the
Odyssey, at least, the imposition, or even the disclosure
of a name, was a matter clothed with a certain
solemn importance. He lets us know how and
why his hero came to be called ‘Odysseus,’ and
furnishes us, to the best of his ability, with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>etymological interpretation of that ill-omened title.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c017'><b>[80]</b></a>
How distinctively human a thing it is to have a
name we are made to feel when Alcinous conjures
his mysterious guest to reveal the designation by
which he is known to his parents, fellow-citizens, and
countrymen, ‘since no man, good or bad, is anonymous’!<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c017'><b>[81]</b></a>
And the reply is couched in an earnest
and exalted strain, conveying at once the extent of
the trust reposed, and the momentousness of the
revelation granted—</p>

<p class='c015'>The same scene, thrown into a grotesque form, is
repeated in the cave of Polyphemus, where the upshot
of the adventure depends wholly upon the prudence
of the storm-tossed chieftain in responding to
the monster’s vinous enthusiasm with the mock disclosure
of a <i>no-name</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>These illustrations help to make it plain that, in
assigning to brutes individual appellations, we bestow
upon them something essentially human, which they
have not, and cannot have of themselves, but which
marks their share in human interests, and their
claim on human sympathy. So accurately is this
true, that a table showing the relative frequency
of individual nomenclature for different animals in
various countries would assuredly, on the strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>of that fact alone, set forth their relative position in
the estimation of man.</p>

<p class='c015'>The dog Argus belonged presumably to the famous
Molossian breed, the first specimen of which was fabled
to have been cast in bronze by Hephæstus,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c017'><b>[83]</b></a> and presented
by Jupiter to Cephalus, the eponymous ruler of
the island of Cephallenia. These animals were not
more remarkable for fierceness than for fidelity. To the
race were assigned creatures of such evil mythological
reputation as the voracious hound of Hades, and
the barking pack of Scylla; a Molossian sent to
Alexander was stated to have brought down a lion;
while, on the other hand, the canine detective of
Montargis had a rival in the army of Pyrrhus, whose
funeral pile was signalised by a desperate act of
canine self-immolation; and the dog of Eupolis (likewise
a Molossian), after having torn to pieces a
thieving servant, died of grief and voluntary starvation
on the grave of the Æginetan poet.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c017'><b>[84]</b></a> These
qualities are presented and perpetuated in the four
dogs of Eumæus and the neglected hound of Odysseus.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f83'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r83'>83</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From this legend the poet not improbably derived the idea of

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>A dog is simply a dog, as a horse is a horse. But
individual horses are in the Iliad distinguished by
differences of colour, while no colour-epithet is anywhere
applied to a dog. It is probable, however, that
in the shepherd-dogs of Albania an almost perfect
reproduction of the animals dear to the poet is still to
be found. For in that wild and mountainous region
the Chaonian or Molossian race is said to survive
undegenerate, and, judging by the reports of travellers,
its modern representatives preserve the same
vigilance in duty and alacrity in attack which distinguished
the formidable band of the Odyssean swineherd.
An English explorer, who had some serious
encounters with them, has described these fierce pastoral
guardians as ‘varying in colour from dark-brown
to bright dun, their long fur being very soft,
thick, and glossy. In size they are equal to an
English mastiff. They have a long nose, delicate ears
finely pointed, magnificent tail, legs of a moderate
length, with a body nicely rounded and compact.’<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c017'><b>[85]</b></a>
It is added that they still possess the strength, swiftness,
sagacity, and fidelity anciently ascribed to them,
showing their pedigree to be probably unimpaired.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Suliot dog, or German boar-hound, comes
from the same region, and has also strong claims to
the honours of Molossian descent. Some of the breed
were employed by the Turkish soldiery in the earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>part of this century, to guard their outposts against
Austrian attacks; and one captured specimen, presented
to the King of Naples, was reputed to be the
largest dog in existence.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c017'><b>[86]</b></a> Measuring nearly four feet
from the shoulder to the ground, he in fact rivalled
the dimensions of a Shetland pony. Others were
secured as regimental pets, and used to make a grand
show in Brussels, marching with their respective
corps to the blare of martial music. They were
fierce-natured animals, rough-coated, and coarsely
formed; mostly tan-coloured, but with blackish markings
on the back, shoulders, and round the ears.
Tan-coloured, too, was probably the immortal Argus;
and we can further picture him, on the assumption
that the modern races west of Pindus reproduce
many features of his aspect, as a wolf-like hound,
with a bushy tail, small, sensitive ears, and a glance
at once eager, intelligent, and wistful. Drooping ears
in dogs are, it may be remarked, a result of domestication;
and varieties distinguished by them were
unknown in Europe until Alexander the Great introduced
from Asia some specimens of the mastiff kind.

of Theseus—</p>

<p class='c024'>is one among many examples of his genial disregard
for archæological detail. Argus, then, resembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>‘White-breasted Bran,’ the dog of Fingal, in his possession
of ‘an ear like a leaf.’</p>
<p class='c015'>It is not too much to say that the opposed sentiments
concerning the relations of men with animals
displayed in the Iliad and Odyssey suffice in themselves
to establish their diversity of origin. For they
render it psychologically impossible that they could
have been the work of one individual. The varying
<i>prominence</i> assigned respectively to the horse and the
dog might, it is true, be plausibly accounted for by
the diversified conditions of the two epics; but no
shifting of scene can explain a <i>reversal</i> of sympathies.
Such sentiments form part of the ingrained structure
of the mind. They take root before consciousness is
awake, or memory active; they live through the decades
of a man’s life; are transported with him from
shore to shore; survive the enthusiasm of friendship
and the illusions of ambition; they can no more be
eradicated from the tenor of his thoughts than the
type of his features can be changed from Tartar to
Caucasian, or the colour of his eyes from black to
blue.</p>

<p class='c015'>After all, the difficulty of separating the origin of
these stupendous productions is considerably diminished
by the reflection that they are but the surviving
members of an extensive group of poems, all
originally attributed without discrimination to a single
author. Not the Iliad and Odyssey alone, but the
‘Cypria,’ the ‘Æthiopis,’ the ‘Lesser Iliad,’ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>other voluminous metrical compositions, were, in the
old, uncritical, individual sense, ‘Homeric.’ So apt

<p class='c021'>The depreciatory tone of the query, ‘What’s in a
name?’ should not lead us to undervalue that indispensable
requisite to sustained and specialised existence.
A name is, indeed, a power in itself. It serves,
at the least, as a peg to hang a personality upon,
and not the most ‘powerful rhyme’ can sustain a
reputation apart from its humble aid. But the bard
of Odysseus has long ceased to possess one. His only
appellation must remain for all time that of his
hero in the Cyclops’ cave. The jealous Muses have
blotted him out from memory. We can only be sure
that he was a man who, like the protagonist of his
immortal poem, had known, and seen, and suffered
many things, who had tears for the past, and hopes
for the future, had roamed far and near with a ‘hungry
heart,’ and had listened long and intently to the
‘many voices’ of the moaning sea; who had tried his
fellow-men, and found them, not all, nor everywhere
wanting; who had faith in the justice of Heaven and
the constancy of woman; who had experienced and
had not disdained to cherish in his heart the life-long
fidelity of a dog.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> greater part of the Continent of Europe, including
Britain, not then, perhaps, insulated by a ‘silver
streak,’ was prehistorically overrun with shaggy
ponies, large-headed and heavily-built, but shown by
their short, pointed ears and brush-tails to have been
genuine <i>horses</i>, exempt from leanings towards the
asinine branch of the family. This, indeed, would be
a hazardous statement to make upon the sole evidence
of the fragmentary piles of these animals’ bones preserved
in caves and mounds; since even a complete
skeleton could tell the most experienced anatomist
nothing as to the shape of their ears or the growth
of hair upon their tails. We happen, however, to be
in possession of their portraits. For the men of that
time had artistic instincts, and drew with force and
freedom whatever seemed to them worthy of imitation;
and among their few subjects the contemporary
wild horse was fortunately included. With his outward
aspect, then, we are, through the medium of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>these diluvial <i>graffiti</i>, on bone-surfaces and stags’
antlers, thoroughly familiar.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was that of a sturdy brute, thirteen or fourteen
hands high, not ill represented, on a reduced scale,
by the Shetland ponies of our own time, but untamed,
and, it might have been thought, untameable. The
race had not then found its true vocation. Man was
enabled, by his superior intelligence, to make it his
prey, but had not yet reached the higher point of
enlisting its matchless qualities in his service. Horses
were, accordingly, neither ridden nor driven, but
hunted and eaten. Piles of bones still attest the hippophagous
habits of the ‘stone-men.’ At Solutré, near
Mâcon, a veritable equine Golgotha has been excavated;
similar accumulations were found in the recesses
of Monte Pellegrino in Sicily; and Sir Richard
Owen made the curious remark that, evidently through
gastronomic selection, the osseous remains of colts
and fillies vastly predominated, in the débris from the
cave of Bruniquel, over those of full-grown horses.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c017'><b>[87]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The descent of our existing horses from the cave-animals
is doubtful, Eastern importations having at
any rate greatly improved and modified the breed.
Wild horses, indeed, still at the end of the sixteenth
century roamed the slopes of the Vosges, and were
hunted as game in Poland and Lithuania;<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c017'><b>[88]</b></a> but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>may have been <i>muzins</i>, or runaways, like the mustangs
on the American prairies. Nowadays, certainly,
the animal is found in a state of aboriginal
freedom nowhere save on the steppes of Central Asia,
in the primitive home of the race. There, in all likelihood,
the noblest of brute-forms was brought to
perfection; there it was dominated by man; and
thence equestrian arts, with their manifold results for
civilisation, were propagated among the nations of
the world. They were taught to the Egyptians, it
would seem, by their shepherd conquerors, but were
not learned by the Arabs until a couple of millenniums
later, the Arab contingent in Xerxes’ army
having been a ‘camel-corps.’ The Persians, indeed,
early picked up the habit of riding from the example
of their Tartar neighbours; yet that it was no original
Aryan accomplishment, the absence of a common
Aryan word to express the idea sufficiently shows.
The relations of our primitive ancestors with the
animal had, at the most, reached what might be called
the second, or Scythian stage, when droves of half-wild
horses took the place of cattle, and mares’ milk
was an important article of food. The aboriginal
cavalry of the desert belonged, on the other hand, to
the wide kinship of Attila’s Huns, who, separated
from their steeds, were as helpless as swans on shore.
The war-chariot, however, was an Assyrian invention,
dating back at least to the seventeenth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
It quickly reached Egypt on one side, India on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>other, and was adopted, some time before the Dorian
invasion, by the Achæans of the Peloponnesus. Mycenæan
grave-stones of about the twelfth century are
engraven with battle and hunting scenes, the actors
in which are borne along in vehicles of essentially the
same construction with those brought before us in
the Iliad. They show scarcely any variation from
the simple model developed on the banks of the Tigris;
yet there was no direct imitation. Homer was profoundly
unconscious of Ninevite splendours. He had
no inkling of the existence of a great Mesopotamian
monarchy far away to the East, beyond the rising-places
of the sun, where one branch of his dichotomised
Ethiopians dwelt in peace. Nevertheless, the
life that he knew, and that was glorified by him, was
touched with many influences from this unknown
land. If some of them filtered through Egypt on
their way, acquaintance with the art of charioteering
certainly took a less circuitous route. For the third
horse of the original Assyrian team was never introduced
into Egypt, and was early discarded in Assyria
itself. He figures continually, however, in Homeric
engagements, running, loosely attached, beside the
regularly yoked pair, one of whom he was destined to
replace in case of emergency. The presence, then, of
this ‘silly,’ or roped horse,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c017'><b>[89]</b></a> παρήορος ἵππος, demonstrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>both the high antiquity, and the Anatolian
negotiation, of the loan which included him.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r89'>89</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The word ‘silly’ thus applied is evidently cognate with the
German <i>Seile</i> = Greek σειρὰ, a rope, from the root <i>swar</i>, to tie. So in
the <i>Ancient Mariner</i>, the ‘<i>silly</i> buckets on the deck’ are the buckets
attached to a rope. Similarly, the third horse was sometimes called
by the Greeks σειραφόρος, ‘drawing by a rope.’</p>

<p class='c015'>The fertile plains of Babylonia probably furnished
the equine supplies of Egypt and Asia Minor during
some centuries before the Nisæan stock,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c017'><b>[90]</b></a> cultivated in
Media, acquired its Hellenic reputation. So far as
can be judged from ancient vase-paintings, the horses
of Achilles and Hector were of pure Oriental type.
They owned the same points of breeding—the small
heads, slender yet muscular legs, and high-arching
necks, the same eager eye and proud bearing, characterising
the steeds that shared the triumphs of Asurbanipal
and Shalmaneser. The same quasi-heroic
position, too, belonged to the horse in the camp before
Troy and at Nineveh. He shared, in both scenes of
action, only the nobler pursuits of man, and was
exempt from the drudgery of servile work. The
beasts of burden, alike of the Iliad and of the sculptures
of Khorsabad and Kouyunjik, were mules and
oxen, not horses. Equine co-operation was reserved
for war and the chace—for war alone, indeed, by the
Homeric Greeks, who appear always to have hunted
on foot. This was inevitable. Modes of conveyance,
were they drawn by Sleipnir or Areion, would have
been an encumbrance in pursuing game through the
thickets of Parnassus, or over the broken skirts of
Mount Ida.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Only the chief Greek and Trojan leaders rode in
chariots. Their possession was a mark of distinction,
and conferred the power of swift locomotion, but was
otherwise of no military use. Their owners alighted
from them for the serious business of fighting, although
glad, if worsted or disabled, to fall back upon
the utmost speed of their horses to carry them out of
reach of their foes. This fashion of warfare, however,
had completely disappeared from Greece proper
before the historic era. Only in Cyprus, chariots are
heard of among the paraphernalia of battle in
498 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c017'><b>[91]</b></a> None figured at Marathon or Mantineia;

</div>

<p class='c015'>The definiteness of intention with which Homeric
epithets were bestowed is strikingly evident in the
distribution of those relating to equestrian pursuits.
That they have no place worth mentioning in the
Odyssey, readers of our last chapter will be prepared
to hear; nor are they sprinkled at random
through the Iliad. Thus, while the Trojans collectively
are frequently called ‘horse-tamers,’ <i>hippodamoi</i>—a
designation still appropriate to the dwellers
round Hissarlik—the Greeks collectively are never
so described.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c017'><b>[92]</b></a> They could not have been, in fact,
without some degree of incongruity. For many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>of them, being of insular origin and maritime habits,
knew as much about hippogriffs as about horses, unless
it were the white-crested ones ruled by Poseidon.
And the poet’s close instinctive regard to such distinctions
appears in the remarkable circumstance that
Odysseus and Ajax Telamon, islanders both, are the
only heroes of the first rank who invariably combat
on foot.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f92'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The individual Greek warriors singled out for
praise as ‘horse-tamers’ are only two—Thrasymedes
and Diomed. The choice had, in each case, readily
discernible motives. Thrasymedes was a son of
Nestor; and Nestor, through his father Peleus, was
sprung from Poseidon, the creator and patron of the
horse. This mythical association resulted from a
natural sequence of ideas. The absence of the horse
from the ‘glist’ring zodiac’ is one of many proofs of
his strangeness to Eastern mythology; but the neglect
was compensated in the West. His position in Greek
folk-lore, according to Dr. Milchhöfer,<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c017'><b>[93]</b></a> indicates a
primitive confusion of thought between winds and
waves as cause and effect, or rather, perhaps, tells of
the transference to the sea of the cloud-fancies of an inland
people. However this be, horse-headed monsters
are extremely prevalent on the archaic engraved
stones found numerously in the Peloponnesus and
the islands of the Ægean; and these monsters—winged,
and with birds’ legs—represent, it would seem, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>original harpy-form in which early Greek imagination
embodied the storm-winds—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The horse-headed Demeter, too, was one of the
Erinyes, under-world dæmonic beings of windy origin,
merging indeed into the Harpies. The Homeric
Harpy Podarge, mother of the immortal steeds of
Achilles, was, moreover, of scarcely disguised equine
nature; while the colts of Ericthonius had Boreas
for their sire.</p>

<p class='c019'>So Æneas related to Achilles; not perhaps without
some touch of metaphor.</p>
<p class='c015'>The figure of speech by which the swiftest of
known animals was likened to a rushing tempest, lay
ready at hand; and a figure of speech is apt to be
treated as a statement of fact by men who have not
yet learned to make fine distinctions. Upon this
particular one as a basis, a good deal of fable was
built. The northern legends, for instance, of the
Wild Huntsman, and of the rides of the blusterous
Odin upon an eight-legged charger equally at home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>on land and on sea; besides the story of the strong
horse Svadilfaxi, personifying the North Wind, who
helped his master, the icy Scandinavian winter, to
build the castle of the Asar. The same obvious
similitude was carried out, by southern imaginations,
in the subjection of the horse to the established
ruler of winds and waves, who is even qualified by
the characteristically equine epithet ‘dark-maned’
(κυανοχαίτης.)<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c017'><b>[95]</b></a> The attribution, however, to Poseidon
of a more or less equine nature may have been immediately
suggested by the resemblance, palpable to
unsophisticated folk, of his crested billows to the impetuous
advance of galloping steeds, whose flowing
manes and curving lineaments of changeful movement
seemed to reproduce the tossing spray and
thunderous charge of the ‘earth-shaking’ element.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r95'>95</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cf. Geddes, <i>Problem of the Homeric Poems</i>, p. 207.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In the Thirteenth Iliad, the closeness of this relationship
is naïvely brought into view. The occasion
was a pressing one. Nothing less was contemplated
than the affording of surreptitious divine aid to the
hard-pressed Achæan host; and the ‘shining eyes’ of
Zeus, whose interdict was still in full force, might at
any moment revert from the Thracians and Hippomolgi
to the less virtuous Greeks and Trojans.
Everything, then, depended upon promptitude, and
Poseidon accordingly, in the absence of his consort
Amphitrite, did not disdain to act as his own groom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Himself he harnessed to his brazen car the ‘bronze-hoofed’
coursers stabled beneath the sea at Ægæ;
himself wielded the golden scourge with which he
urged their rapid passage, amid the damp homage of
dutiful but dripping sea-monsters, to a submarine
recess between Tenedos and Imbros:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And the sea’s face was parted with a smile,</div>
      <div class='line'>And rapidly the horses sped the while.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c017'><b>[96]</b></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>There he himself provided ambrosial forage for their
support during his absence on the battle-field, taking
the precaution, before his departure, of attaching
infrangible golden shackles to the agile feet that might
else have been tempted to stray. Yet all this pains
was taken for the mere sake of what must be called
‘swagger.’ Poseidon, calmly seated on the Samothracian
height, was already within full view of the
plain and towers of Ilium, when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in27'>Sudden at last</div>
      <div class='line'>He rose, and swiftly down the steep he passed,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mountain trembled with each step he took,</div>
      <div class='line'>The forest with the quaking mountain shook.</div>
      <div class='line'>Three strides he made, and with the fourth he stood</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>And the journey westward was deliberately made
for the purpose of fetching an equipage which proved
rather an embarrassment than an assistance to him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>‘But for the honour of the thing,’ as an Irishman
remarked of his jaunt in a bottomless sedan-chair, he
‘might just as well have walked.’</p>

</div>
<p class='c015'>Not without reason, then, was equestrian skill associated
with Poseidonian lineage. Nestor himself
was an enthusiastic horse-lover; yet the Pylian breed
was none of the best; and he anxiously warned his
son Antilochus, preparatory to the starting of the
chariot-race commemorative of Patroclus, that he
must supply by finesse for the slowness of his team.
Poseidon himself, he reminded him, had been his
instructor; and no less, it may be presumed, of his
brother Thrasymedes, whose feats in this direction,
however, are summed up in the laudatory expression
bestowed on him in common with Diomed.</p>

<p class='c015'>The connoisseurship of this latter, on the contrary,
is perpetually in evidence. As king of ‘horse-feeding
Argos,’ he knew and prized what was best in
horseflesh, and counted no risk too great for the purpose
of securing it. His brilliant success accordingly,
in the capture of famous steeds, rendered the original
inferiority of his own a matter of indifference. It
served, indeed, only to quicken his zeal to replace
them by force or fraud with better. And it fell out
most opportunely that, just at the conjuncture when
the protection of Athene rendered him irresistible,
Æneas, temporarily allied with the Lycian archer
Pandarus, undertook the hopeless task of staying his
victorious career. The Dardanian hero was driving a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>matchless team, ‘the best under the dawn or the sun’;
and he found leisure, notwithstanding the celerity
of their onset, to extol their qualities to his companion,
while Diomed recited the to him familiar tale of their
pedigree to his charioteer, Sthenelus. They were of
the race of those with which the ransom of Ganymede
had been paid by Zeus to Tros, King of Phrygia, his
father, and were hence known distinctively as <i>Trojan</i>
horses. Their possession was regarded as of inestimable
importance.</p>

<p class='c015'>That was the day of glory of the son of Tydeus,
whom ‘Pallas Athene did not permit to tremble.’
Destiny waited on his desires. His spear sent Pandarus
to the shades; Æneas was barely rescued by the
maternal intervention of Aphrodite, who came off by no
means scatheless from the adventure. Above all, the
Dardanian ‘messengers of terror’ were led in triumph
across to the Achæan camp. They did not remain
there idle. On the following day, Nestor was invited
to admire their paces, as they carried him and their
new master beyond the reach of Hector’s fury, the
fortune of war having by that time effectively changed
sides. Their subsequent victory in the Patroclean
chariot-race was a foregone conclusion. For their
Olympian connexions would have made their defeat
by clover-cropping animals of ordinary lineage appear
a gross anomaly; and the horses of Achilles, as being
immortal and invincible, were expressly excluded from
the competition.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>The night-adventure of Diomed and Odysseus,
narrated in the Tenth Iliad, is unmistakably an
after-thought and interlude. To what precedes it is
in part irrelevant; with what follows it is wholly unconnected;
nor is it logically complete in itself. The
interpolation is, none the less, of respectable antiquity,
going back certainly to the eighth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; it has
high merits of its own, and could ill be spared from
the body of what it is convenient to call Homeric
poetry. Its admission, to be sure, crowds into one
night performances enough to occupy several, but this
superfluity of business scarcely troubles any genially
disposed reader; nor need he grudge Odysseus the
three suppers—one of them perhaps better described
as a breakfast—amply earned by his indefatigable
services in the epic cause, and counterbalanced by
many subsequent privations. The point, however, to
be specially noted by us here, is that in the ‘Doloneia’—as
the tenth book is designated—equestrian
interests, its extraneous origin notwithstanding, are
paramount.</p>

<p class='c015'>The opening situation is that magnificently described
at the close of the eighth book, when the
‘dark-ribbed ships’ by the Hellespont seemed to
cower before the menacing camp-fires of the victorious
Trojans. Indeed, most of those who lay in their
shadow would gladly have grasped, before it was too
late, at the means of escape they offered. Agamemnon’s
fluctuating mind, too, might easily have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>brought to that inglorious decision; but for the
moment, he relieved his restless anxiety by hastily
summoning to a nocturnal council a few of the most
prominent Achæan chiefs. The somewhat inadequate
result of their deliberations was the despatch of a
scouting party to the Trojan quarters, Diomed and
Odysseus being inevitably chosen for the discharge of
the perilous office—inevitably, since in the legend of
Troy, these two are again and again coupled in the
performance of venturesome, if not questionable,
exploits.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c017'><b>[98]</b></a> They had sallied forth unarmed on the
sudden summons of the ‘king of men,’ but collected
from the sympathetic bystanders a scratch-lot of

emergency a peculiar head-piece of leather lined with
felt, and strengthened with rows of boars’ teeth,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c017'><b>[99]</b></a> the
like of which, judging from the profusion of sliced
tusks met with in Mycenæan graves, was probably
familiar of old in the Peloponnesus.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was pitch dark as the adventurers traversed the
marshy land about the Simoeis; but the rise, with
heavy wing-flappings, of a startled heron on their
right, dispelled their misgivings, and evoked their
pious rejoicings at the assurance it afforded of
Athene’s protection. Their next encounter was with
Hector’s emissary, the luckless Dolon, a poor creature
beyond doubt, vain, feather-headed, unstable, pusillanimous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>yet piteous to us even now in the sanguine
loquacity that merged into a death-shriek as the
fierce blade of Diomed severed the tendons of his
throat. He had served his purpose, and was contemptuously,
nay treacherously, dismissed from life.
But the temptation suggested by him was irresistible.
Instincts of cupidity, keen in both heroes, had been
fully roused by his account of the splendid and unguarded
equipment of the newly-arrived leader of a
Thracian contingent to the Trojan army. As he told
them:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>King Rhesus, Eionëus’ son, commands them, who hath steeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>More white than snow, huge, and well shaped; their fiery pace exceeds</div>
      <div class='line'>The winds in swiftness; these I saw, his chariot is with gold</div>
      <div class='line'>And pallid silver richly framed, and wondrous to behold;</div>
      <div class='line'>His great and golden armour is not fit a man should wear,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for immortal shoulders framed.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c017'><b>[100]</b></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f100'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r100'>100</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Iliad</i>, x. 435-41 (Chapman’s trans.).</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Now Odysseus and Diomed both loved plunder;
each in his own way was of a reckless and dare-devil
disposition; and one at any rate was a passionate
admirer of equine beauty. They accordingly did not
hesitate to follow up Dolon’s indications, which proved
quite accurate. The followers of Rhesus were weary
from their recent journey; Diomed had no difficulty
in slaying a dozen of them in ranks as they slept, and
so reaching the king, whose premonitory nightmare of
destruction was abruptly dissolved by its realisation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The coveted horses tethered alongside having been
meanwhile secured by Odysseus, swiftly conveyed the
exultant raiders back to the Achæan ships.</p>

<p class='c015'>But in what manner? On their backs or drawn
behind them in the glittering Thracian chariot?
Opinions are divided. Euripides assumed that the
latter formed part of the booty,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c017'><b>[101]</b></a> yet the Homeric expressions
rather imply that it was left <i>in statu quo</i>.
They are not, on the other hand, easily reconciled
with the supposition of an escape on horseback from
the scene of carnage. This, none the less, was almost
certainly what the poet meant to convey, and his unfamiliarity
with the art of riding was doubtless the
cause of his conveying it badly.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c017'><b>[102]</b></a> Homeric heroes, as
a rule infringed only by this one exception, never
mounted their steeds; they used them solely in light
draught. Equitation was indeed known of as a
branch in which special skill might be acquired; but
for the ignoble purpose of popular, perhaps venal,
display. Thus the performance of leaping from one to
the other of four galloping horses, brought in to illustrate
the agility with which Ajax strode from deck to
deck of the menaced Thessalian ships,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c017'><b>[103]</b></a> excites indeed
astonishment, but astonishment of the inferior kind
raised by the feats of a clown or a circus-rider. The
passage has found a curious commentary in a faded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>painting on a wall of the ancient palace at Tiryns, representing
an acrobat springing on the back of a
rushing bull.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c017'><b>[104]</b></a> He is unmistakably a specimen of the
class of performer to which the nimble equestrian of
the Iliad belonged.</p>

<p class='c015'>The animated story of the Doloneia, however, originated
most likely in a primitive nature-parable,
symbolising, in one of its innumerable forms, the ever-renewed
struggle of darkness with light. The prize
carried off by Diomed and Odysseus was, this being
so, nothing less than the equipage of the sun; yet the
solar horses are, mythologically, scarcely separable
from the vehicle attached to them. Our bard, it is
true, being wholly intent upon the concrete aspect of
the tale he had to tell, felt no incongruity in the disjunction;
and he certainly took no pains to perpetuate
the traditional shape of his materials. Unconsciously,
however, he has allowed some vestiges of
solar relationships to survive among the less fortunate
actors in his little drama. They can be traced
in the wrath of Apollo at the exploit achieved, while
he was off his guard, through the assistance of the
predatory Athene;<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c017'><b>[105]</b></a> and perhaps in the costume of
Dolon, who clothed himself, we are told, for his disastrous
expedition in ‘the skin of a grey wolf.’ Now
the wolf became early entangled, in Aryan folk-lore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>with luminous associations. At first, possibly through
contrast and antagonism, exemplified in the hostile
pursuit, by the Scandinavian animal, of the sun and
moon; later, through capricious identification. The
lupine connexions of the Hellenic Apollo may be thus
explained. They were, at any rate, strongly accentuated;
and Dolon wore, in some sense, albeit ignobly,
‘the livery of the burnished sun.’</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f105'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r105'>105</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is worth notice that in the Euripidean tragedy <i>Rhesos</i>,
‘Phœbos’ is the watchword for that night.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Manifestly solar, on the other hand, are the
snowy horses from across the Hellespont. Nestor,
who, characteristically enough, first caught the sound
of their galloping approach to the Greek outposts,
demanded of their captors in amazement:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How have you made this horse your prize? Pierced you the dangerous host,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where such gems stand? Or did some god your high attempts accost,</div>
      <div class='line'>And honoured you with this reward? Why, they be like the rays</div>
      <div class='line'>The sun effuseth.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c017'><b>[106]</b></a></div>

<p class='c015'>The Thracian pair, moreover, are the only <i>white</i>
horses mentioned in the Iliad. All the rest were
chestnut, bay, or brown. One of those reft from
Æneas by Diomed, was sorrel, with a white crescent
on the forehead;<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c017'><b>[107]</b></a> Achilles, or Patroclus for him,
drove a chestnut and a piebald; a pair of rufous bays
drew the chariot of Asius. No black horse appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>on the scene; nor can we be sure that the ‘dark-maned,’
mythical Areion was really understood to be
of sable tint. Admiration for white horses was not
spontaneous among the Greeks. It sprang up in the
East as a consequence of their figurative association
with the sun. The Iranian fable of the solar chariot
drawn by spotless coursers, carried everywhere with
it, in its diffusion west, south, and north, an imaginative
impression of the sacredness of such animals.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c017'><b>[108]</b></a>
They were chosen out for the Magian sacrifices;<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c017'><b>[109]</b></a> they
were tended in Scandinavian temple-enclosures, and
their neighings oracularly interpreted;<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c017'><b>[110]</b></a> a white
horse was dubiously reported by Strabo to be periodically
immolated by the Veneti in commemoration of
Diomed’s fabulous sovereignty over the Adriatic;<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c017'><b>[111]</b></a>
and it became a recognised mythological principle
that superhuman beings should be, like the Wild
Huntsman of the Black Forest, <i>Schimmelreiter</i>.
‘White as snow’ were the steeds of the Great Twin
Brethren; white as snow the ‘horse with the terrible
rider’ in Raphael’s presentation of the Vision that
vindicated the sanctity of the Jewish Temple; Odin
thundered over the mountain-tops on a pallid courser;
and it was deemed scandalous presumption in Camillus
to have his triumphal chariot drawn to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Capitol after the fall of Veii by a milk-white team, fit
only for the transport of an immortal god.</p>

<p class='c015'>Such, too, were the horses of Rhesus; and their
evanescent appearance in Homeric narrative tallies
with their unsubstantial nature. They sink into
complete oblivion after the scene of their nocturnal
abduction. Their quondam master could lay claim
to scarcely a more solid core of existence. Euripides’
account of his parentage is that he was the son of the
River Strymon and of the muse Terpsichore; which,
being interpreted, means that he personified a local
stream.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c017'><b>[112]</b></a> He obtained, however, posthumous reputation
and honours, as a prophet at Amphipolis, as a
rider and hunter at Rhodope.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The relations of men and horses are, in every
part of the Iliad, systematically regulated and consistently
maintained. There is nothing casual about
them. Thus, Paris’s lack of a conveyance serves to
emphasise his inferiority in the field. He was a
craven at close quarters, though formidable as a bow-man,
despatching his arrows from the safe shelter of
the ranks. For the adventurous sallies rendered possible
only by the aid of fleet steeds, he had neither
taste nor aptitude.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hector, on the contrary, was distinguished above
all other Homeric warriors by driving four horses
abreast—above all Homeric gods and goddesses
even, since Poseidon himself, Ares, Heré, and Eos,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>were content each with a pair. In their case, however,
the seeming deficiency was a point of real superiority.
For no more than two horses can have been
in effective employment in drawing Hector’s chariot,
the remaining two being held in reserve against accidents.
But Olympian coursers were presumably
exempt from mortal casualties, and there was hence
no need to provide for the emergency of their disablement.
Critics, nevertheless, of the ultra-strict school,
taking offence at the unexpected introduction of a
four-in-hand, have proclaimed the entire enshrining
passage spurious. Perhaps on insufficient grounds;
yet as to this there may be two opinions; there can
be only one as to its being stirring and splendid.</p>

<p class='c015'>The formal introduction of the only horses on the
Trojan side dignified with proper names, makes an
impressive exordium to the lay of Trojan victory after
Diomed’s audacious resistance had been turned to
flight by the thunder-bolt of Zeus. Hector’s fiery incitements
were addressed no less earnestly to his equine
servants than to his Lycian and Dardanian allies.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then cherished he his famous horse: O Xanthus now, said he,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou Podargus, Æthon, too, and Lampus, dear to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Make me some worthy recompense for so much choice of meat</div>
      <div class='line'>Given you by fair Andromache; bread of the purest wheat,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with it for your drink mixed wine, to make ye wished cheer,</div>

</div>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>He went on to represent to them the glorious fruits
and triumphs of victory, but gave no hint of a penalty
for defeat. The absence of any such savage threat
as Antilochus hurled at his slow-paced steeds in the
chariot-race marks his innate gentleness of soul. He
urged only the nobler motives for exertion appropriate
to conscious intelligence. Trust in equine sympathy
is, indeed, widespread in legend and romance. Even
the cruel Mezentius, wounded and doomed, made a
final appeal to the pride and valour of his faithful
Rhœbus; to say nothing of ‘Auld Maitland’s’ son’s
call upon his ‘Gray,’ of the stirrup-rhetoric of Reynaud
de Montauban, of Marko, the Cid of Servia, of
the Eddic Skirnir starting for Jotunheim, or other
imperilled owners of renowned steeds.</p>

<p class='c015'>These, now and then, are enabled to respond; but
speaking horses should be reserved for emergencies.
They occur, for instance, with undue profusion in
modern Greek folk-songs. Not every notorious klepht
lurking in the thickets of Pindus, but only some hero
towering to the clouds of fancy, should, rightly considered,
possess an animal so exceptionally endowed.
The lesson is patent in the Iliad. Homer’s instinctive
self-restraint and supreme mastery over the
secrets of artistic effect are nowhere more conspicuous
than in his treatment of the horses of Achilles.</p>

<p class='c015'>‘Thessalian steeds and Lacedæmonian women’
were declared by an oracle to be the best Greek representatives
of their respective kinds. In Thessaly was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the legendary birthplace of the horse; there lived
the Lapiths—if Virgil is to be believed—the first
horse-breakers:</p>

<p class='c024'>There, too, the Centaurs were at home; the Thessalian
cavalry became historically famous; the Thessalian
marriage ceremony long included the presentation
to the bride by the bridegroom, of a fully caparisoned
horse;<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c017'><b>[115]</b></a> and the noble equine type of the Parthenon

<p class='c015'>Only, indeed, a fraud on the part of Athene prevented
the mares of Eumelus from winning the
chariot-race against the heaven-descended ‘Trojan’
horses of Diomed; and the Muse, solemnly invoked
as arbitress of equine excellence, declared them the
goodliest of all ‘the steeds that followed the sons of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Atreus to war,’ save, of course, the incomparable
Pelidean pair.</p>

<p class='c015'>Xanthus and Balius were the wedding-gift of Poseidon
to Peleus. The sea-god himself had been a
suitor for the hand of the bride, the silver-footed
Thetis; but, on its becoming known that the son to
be born of her marriage was destined to surpass the
strength of his father, something of an Olympian
panic prevailed, and a mortal bridegroom was, by the
common determination of the alarmed Immortals,
forced upon the reluctant goddess. Of this unequal
and unhappy marriage, the far-famed Achilles was
the ill-starred offspring.</p>

<p class='c015'>So intense is the Homeric realisation of the hero’s
superhuman powers, that they scarcely excite surprise.
And his belongings are on the scale of his
qualities. None but himself could wield his spear;
his armour was forged in Olympus; his shield was a
panorama of human life; his horses would obey only
his guidance, or that of his delegates. Not for common
handling, indeed, were the ‘wind-swift’ coursers
born of Zephyr and the Harpy on the verge of the
dim Ocean-stream. Themselves deathless and invulnerable,
they were destined, nevertheless, to share
the pangs of ‘brief mortality.’</p>

of his duel with Patroclus. And they had to endure
worse than the loss of Pedasus. Patroclus, whose

love, fell in the same fight, and they stood paralysed
with grief, and unheeding alike the blows and the

<p class='c015'>The final appearance of the Pelidean steeds upon
the scene of the Iliad reaches a tragic height, probably
unequalled in the whole cycle of poetical delineations
from the lower animal-world. Achilles,

</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> establishment of a clear distinction between men
and beasts might seem a slight effort of defining intellect,
yet it has not been quite easily made. In
children the instinct of assimilation long survives the
experience of difference. A little boy of six, asked by
the present writer what profession he thought of
adopting, replied with alacrity that he ‘would like to
be a bird,’ and it was only on being reminded of the
diet of grubs associated with that state of life, that he
began to waver as to its desirability. The same incapacity
for drawing a boundary-line between the
realm of their own imperfect consciousness and the
mysterious encompassing region of animal life, is
visible in the grown-up children of the wilds. Hence
the zoological speculations of primitive man inevitably
take the form of a sort of projection of human
faculties into animal natures. Now human faculties,
released from the control of actuality, spontaneously
expand. In a vague and vaporous way, they transcend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the low level of hard fact, and become pleasantly
diffused in the ‘ampler ether’ of the unknown.
Beasts thus transfigured are incapable, it may be
said, of simple rationality. The powers transferred
to them grow like Jack’s Beanstalk, beyond the range
of sight.</p>

<p class='c015'>Universal folk-lore, in all its tangled ramifications,
bears witness to the truth of this remark.
Tutelary animals, of the Puss in Boots type, abound
and expatiate there. They are all-contriving and infallible.
Their favour leads to fortune and power.
They hold the clue to the labyrinth of human destinies.
Through their protection the oppressed are
rescued, the ragged are clothed in golden raiments,
the outwardly despicable win princely honours, and
have their names inscribed in the ‘Almanach de Gotha’
of fairy-land. No wonder that such beneficent potentates,
albeit feathered or furry, should have been
claimed as ancestors and hereditary protectors by
human beings full of untutored yearnings for the unattainable.
To our ideas, indeed, there seems little
comfort or credit to be got out of counting kinship
with a beaver, a bear, or an opossum; but things
looked differently when the world was young; nor
has it yet everywhere grown old. In Australia, black
bipeds still own themselves the cousins and clients of
kangaroos. American Indians pay homage to ‘manitous’
personally, as well as to ‘totems’ tribally
associated with them; and twilight tales are perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>to this hour whispered in Ireland, about a certain
‘Master of the Rats,’ whose hostility it is eminently
undesirable though lamentably easy to incur.</p>

<p class='c015'>Even among Greeks and Romans of the classical
age, to say nothing of Aztecs and Alemanni, belief
lurked in the preternatural wisdom of certain animals.
Their formal worship, most fully elaborated in Egypt,
but diffused over ‘Tellus’ orbed ground,’ sprang from
the same stock of ideas. To a remarkable extent, the
Greeks were exempt from its degrading associations.
Their partial survival on Greek soil, as in the veneration
at Phigaleia, of the horse-headed Demeter, represented,
without doubt, an under-current of aboriginal
tradition, reaching back to the Pelasgic fore-time.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now it might have been anticipated that the
earliest literature would have been the most deeply
permeated by these primitive reminiscences. But
this is very far from being the case. Their influence
is scarcely perceptible in the two great epics of Troy
and Ithaca; and indeed the modes of thought from
which they originated were completely alien to the
ethical sentiments pervading those marvellous first-fruits
of Greek genius. Neither poem includes the
smallest remnant of zoolatry. The Homeric divinities
are absolutely anthropomorphic. They are men
and women, exempt from the limitations, unscathed
by the ills of humanity, and radiant with the infinite
sunshine of immortal happiness. Of infra-human relationships
they exhibit no trace. They are far less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>concerned with the animal kingdom than they grew
to be in classical times. Typical beasts or birds have
not yet become attached to them. The eagle, though
once in the Iliad called the ‘swift messenger’ of Zeus,
is altogether detached from his throne and his thunder-bolt;
Heré has not developed her preference for
the peacock—a bird introduced much later from the
East; Athene is without the companionship of her
owl; no doves flutter about the fair head of the
‘golden Aphrodite’; Artemis needs no dogs to bring
down her game. The Olympian menagerie, in short,
has not been constituted. On the ‘many-folded’
mountain of the gods, no beasts are maintained save
the half-dozen horses strictly necessary for the purposes
of divine locomotion.</p>

<p class='c015'>Very significant, too, is Homer’s ignorance of the
semi-bestial, semi-divine beings who figure in subsequent
Greek mythology. ‘Great Pan’ has no place
in his verse; Satyrs and Tritons are equally unrecognised
by him; his Nereids are ‘silver-footed
sea-nymphs,’ with no fishy tendencies.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mixed natures of any kind seem, in truth, to have
been little to his taste. Even if he could have apprehended
the symbolical meanings underlying them in
dim Oriental imaginations, he could scarcely have
reconciled himself to the sacrifice of beauty which
they involved. Men, horses, bulls, lions, were all
separately admirable in his eyes; but to blend, he felt
instinctively, was not to heighten their perfections.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Thus, the hybrid nature of the Centaurs, if present
to his mind, was left undefined as something ‘abominable,
inutterable.’ The Harpies, realised by Hesiod
as half-human fowls, remained with him barely personified
tornadoes. Neither Pegasus nor the Minotaur,
neither the bird-women of Stymphalis, nor the
Griffons of the Rhipæan mountains, found mention in
his song, and he admitted—and that in a family-legend—but
one true specimen of the dragon-kind
in the ‘Chimæra dire’ slain by Bellerophon. The
monstrosity of Scylla is left purposely vague. She
is a fancy-compound defying classification. She
lived, too, in the outer world of the Odyssey, where
‘things strange and rare’ flourished in quiet disregard
of laws binding elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the same region of wonderland occur the
oxen of the Sun—the only sacred animals recognised
by our poet. They had their pasturing-ground in the
island of Thrinakie, whither Helios retired to divert
himself with their frolics after each hard day of
steady Mediterranean shining; and so keen was his
indignation at their slaughter by the famished comrades
of Odysseus, that a cosmical strike would have
ensued but for the promise of Zeus to inflict condign
punishment upon the delinquents. From the shipwreck
by which this promise was fulfilled, Odysseus,
alone exempt from guilt in the matter, was the solitary
survivor.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Homeric treatment of animals, compared with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the extravagances prevalent in other primitive literature,
is eminently sane and rational. Not through
indifference to their perfections. A peculiar intensity
of sympathy with brute-nature is, on the contrary,
one of the distinguishing characteristics of the
Homeric poems. But that sympathy is based upon
the appreciation of real, not upon the transference of
imaginary qualities. Beasts are, on the whole, kept
strictly in their proper places. The only genuine
example of their sublimation into higher ones is
afforded by the horses of Achilles, and this during
a transport of epic excitement. Otherwise, the
fabulous element admitted concerning animals—and
it is just in their regard that fable commonly runs
riot—is surprisingly small.</p>

<p class='c015'>In its room, we find such a wealth of acute and
accurate observation, as no poet, before or since, has
had the capacity to accumulate, or the power to employ
for purposes of illustration. It is unmistakably
private property. Details appropriated at second-hand
could never have fitted in so aptly with the
needs of imaginative creation. Moreover, the conventional
types of animal character were of later
establishment. There was at that early time no
recognised common stock of popular or proverbial
wisdom on the subject to draw upon. The lion had
not yet been raised to regal dignity; the fox was undistinguished
for craft, as the goose for folly. Beasts
and birds had their careers in literature before them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Their reputations were still to make. They carried
about with them no formal certificates of character.
The poet was accordingly unfettered in his dealings
with them by preconceived notions; whence the
delightful freshness of Homer’s zoological vignettes.
The dew of morning, so to speak, is upon them. They
are limned direct from his own vivid impressions of
pastoral, maritime, and hunting scenes.</p>

<p class='c015'>As to the locality of those scenes, some hints, but
scarcely more than hints, can be derived. For in the
course of nearly three thousand years, the circumstances
of animal distribution have been affected by
changes too considerable and too indeterminate to
admit of confident argument from the state of things
now to the state of things then; while the notices of
the poet, incidental by their very nature, are of the
utmost value for what they tell, but warrant only very
hesitating inferences from what they leave untold.
Thus, it does not follow that because Homer nowhere
mentions the cuckoo, he was therefore unfamiliar with
its note, which, from Hesiod’s time until now, has not
failed to proclaim the advent of spring among the
olive-groves of Bœotia, and must have been heard
no less by Paris or Anchises than by the modern
archæological traveller, along the oak-clad and willow-fringed
valley of Scamander. Nor is the faintest
presumption of a divided authorship supplied by the
fact that the nightingale sings in the Odyssey, but
not in the Iliad. Nevertheless, analogous considerations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>should not be altogether neglected in Homeric
criticism. They may possibly help towards the
answering of questions both of time and place: of
time, through allusions to domesticated animals;
of place, by a comparison of the known range of
wild species with the fauna of the two great epics.
And, first, as regards domesticated animals.</p>

<p class='c015'>The list of these is a short one. The Greeks and
Trojans of the Iliad commanded the services of the
horse in battle, of oxen and mules for draught; dogs
were their faithful allies in hunting and cattle driving,
and they kept flocks of sheep and goats. The ass
appears only once, and then indirectly, on the scene,
when the lethargic obstinacy of his behaviour serves
to heighten the effect of Ajax’s stubbornness in fight.
Thus:</p>

<p class='c022'>And as when a lazy ass going past a field hath the better of the
boys with him, an ass that hath had many a cudgel broken about
his sides, and he fareth into the deep crop, and wasteth it, while
the boys smite him with their cudgels, and feeble is the force of
them, but yet with might and main they drive him forth when he
hath had his fill of fodder; even so did the high-hearted Trojans
and allies, called from many lands, smite great Aias, son of Telamon,
with darts on the centre of his shield, and ever followed
after him.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c017'><b>[136]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The creature’s ‘little ways’ were then already
notorious, although all mention of him or them is
omitted from the Odyssey, as well as from the Hesiodic

<p class='c015'>The Semitic origin of the word ‘ass’ rightly
indicates the introduction of the species into Europe
from Semitic Western Asia. As to the date of its
arrival, all that can be told is that it was subsequent
to the beginning of the bronze epoch. The pile-dwellers
of Switzerland and North Italy were unacquainted
with an animal fundamentally Oriental in
its habitudes. Its reluctance, for instance, to cross the
smallest streamlet attests the physical tradition of
a desert home; and the white ass of Bagdad represents
to this day, the fullest capabilities of the race.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c017'><b>[138]</b></a> Yet
neither the ass nor the camel was included in the
primitive Aryan fauna. For they could not have been
known, still less domesticated, without being named,
and the only widespread appellations borne by them
are derived from Semitic sources. Evidently the loan
of the words accompanied the transmission of the
species. It is very difficult, in the face of this circumstance—as
Dr. Schrader has pertinently observed<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c017'><b>[139]</b></a>—to
locate the Aryan cradle-land anywhere to the east
of the Bosphorus.</p>

have halted in a transition-stage between pastoral

the land supplying pasturage for ubiquitous multitudes

sheep, however, belong to a variety assuredly of post-Homeric
introduction, since the massive tails hampering
their movements could not well have escaped
characterisation in some emphatic Homeric epithet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Both short and long-horned cattle, all of a dark-brown
colour, may now be seen grazing over the
plain round Hissarlik, the latter probably resembling
more closely than the former those with which
Homer was acquainted. The oxen alike of the Iliad
and Odyssey are ‘wine-coloured,’ ‘straight-horned,’
‘broad-browed,’ and ‘sinuous-footed’; it was above
all through the shuffle of their gait, indicated by the
last adjective, and due to the peculiar structure of
the hip-joint in the whole species, that the poet
distinctively visualised them. ‘Lowing kine,’ and
‘bellowing bulls’ are occasionally heard of, chiefly—it
is curious to remark—in later, or suspected
portions of the Iliad. Sheep and goats, on the other
hand, are often described as ‘bleating,’ and the cries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of birds are called up at opportune moments; but
Homer’s horses neither whinny nor neigh; his pigs
refrain from grunting; his jackals do not howl; the
tremendous roar of the lion nowhere resounds through
his forests. Homeric wild beasts are, indeed, save
in the vaguely-indicated case of one indeterminate

<p class='c015'>Singularly enough, a peculiar sensitiveness to
sound is displayed in the description of the Shield of
Achilles. Yet plastic art is essentially silent. Even
the perpetuated cry of the Laocoön detracts somewhat
from the inherent serenity of marble. The metal-wrought
creations of Hephæstus, however, not only
live and move, but make themselves audible to a degree
uncommon elsewhere in the poems. Thus, in
one scene, or compartment, a <i>lowing</i> herd issues to
the pasturing-grounds, where two lions seize from
their midst, and devour, a <i>loudly-bellowing</i> bull, while
nine <i>barking</i>, though frightened dogs are, by the herdsmen,
vainly urged to a rescue. In the vintage-episode
of the same series, delight in melodious beauty is
almost as apparent as in the so-called ‘Homeric’
hymn to Hermes. The ‘Linus-song,’ ‘sweet even as
desire,’ sung to the youthful grape-gatherers, sounds

migration westward of the rat, spread with great
rapidity in the first centuries of the Christian era,

<p class='c015'>The pig was not one of the animals primitively
domesticated in the East. The absence of Vedic or
Avestan mention of swine-culture makes it practically
certain that the species was known only in a
wild state to the early Aryan colonists of Iran and
India. Nor had any more intimate acquaintance
with it been developed in Babylonia; although the
Swiss pile-dwellers, at first similarly behindhand,
advanced, before the stone age had terminated, to
pig-keeping.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c017'><b>[144]</b></a> Dr. Schrader, indeed, bases upon the
occurrence only in European languages of the word
porcus, the conjecture that the subjugation of the ‘full-acorned
boar’ was first accomplished in Europe;<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c017'><b>[145]</b></a>
and if this were so, the operations of swine-herding
would naturally come in for a larger share of notice
in the Odyssey, as the more European of the two
poems, than in the Iliad. And in fact, the swineherd
of Odysseus is an important personage, and plays a
leading part in the drama of his return—pigs, moreover,
figuring extensively among the agricultural
riches of Ithaca, while there is no sign that any were
possessed by Priam or Anchises. Alone among the
Greeks of the Iliad, Achilles is stated to have placed
before his guests a ‘chine of well-fed hog’; and the
very few Iliadic allusions to fatted swine are all in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>immediate connexion with the same hero. If this be
a result of chance, it is a somewhat grotesque one.</p>

<p class='c015'>The porcine proclivities of modern Greeks are
especially strong. Christian and Mahometan habitations
were, in the days of Turkish domination,
easily distinguished by the sty-accommodation attached
to the former; while in certain villages of the
Morea and the Cyclades, the pigs no longer occupied
a merely subordinate position, and odours not Sabæan,
wafted far on the breeze, announced to the still
distant traveller the nature of the harbourage in
store for him.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c017'><b>[146]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The most antique of domesticated birds is the
goose, and Homer was acquainted with no other.
Penelope kept a flock of twenty,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c017'><b>[147]</b></a> mainly, it would
seem, for purposes of diversion, since the loss of them
through the devastations of an eagle is treated from a
purely sentimental point of view. They were fed on
wheat, the ‘height of good living,’ in Homeric back-premises.
The court-yard, too, of the palace of
Menelaus sheltered a cackling flock,<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c017'><b>[148]</b></a> the progenitors
of which Helen might have brought with her from
Egypt, where geese were prehistorically reared for
the table. That the bird occurs <i>only</i> tame in the
Odyssey, and <i>only</i> wild in the Iliad, constitutes a distinction
between the poems which can scarcely be
without real significance. The species employed, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the Second Iliad, to illustrate, by the tumult of their
alighting on the marshy banks of the Cayster, the
clangorous march-past of the Achæan forces, has been

which fly south, in severe winters, from the valley of
the Danube to Greece and Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c015'>The familiar cocks and hens of our poultry-yards
are, in the West, post-Homeric. Their native home
is in India; but through human agency they were
early transported to Iran, where the cock, as the
bird that first greets the light, acquired in the eyes
of Zoroastrian devotees, a pre-eminently sacred
character. His introduction into Greece was a result
of the expansion westward of the Persian empire.
No cocks are met with on Egyptian monuments; the
Old Testament leaves them unnoticed; and the
earliest mention of them in Greek literature is by
Theognis of Megara, in the middle of the sixth century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c017'><b>[149]</b></a> Pigeons, on the other hand, are quite at
home in Homeric verse. They are of two kinds. One
is the rock-pigeon, called from its slate-coloured
plumage <i>peleia</i> (πελόs = dusky), and described as
finding shelter in rocky clefts, and evading pursuit
by a rapid, undulating flight.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c017'><b>[150]</b></a> Its frequent recurrence
in similes can surprise no traveller who has

in 492 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c017'><b>[152]</b></a> Yet dove-culture was practised as far
back as the oldest records lead us in Egypt and Persia.
The dove was marked out as a ‘death-bird’ by our
earliest Aryan ancestors, and figures in the Vedas as
a messenger of Yama. But Homer, unconcerned, as
usual, with animal symbolism, makes no account, if
he had ever heard, of its sinister associations.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among Homeric wild animals, the first place incontestably
belongs to the lion, and the Iliad, in
especial, gives extraordinary prominence to the king of
beasts. In savage grandeur he stalks, as it were,
through the varied scenery of its similitudes, indomitable,
fiercely-despoiling, contemptuous of lesser brute-forces.
His impressive qualities receive no gratuitous
enhancement; he rouses no myth-making fancies;
there is no fabulous ‘quality of mercy’ about him,
nor of magnanimity, nor of forbearance; he is simply
a ‘gaunt and sanguine beast,’ a vivid embodiment of
the energy of untamed and unsparing nature.</p>

<p class='c015'>He is not brought immediately upon the scene
of action; the Homeric poems nowhere provide for
him a local habitation; it is only in the comparatively
late Hymn to Aphrodite that a place is specifically
assigned to him among the feral products of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Mount Ida. His portraiture, nevertheless, in the
similes of the Iliad is too minute and faithful to
leave any shadow of doubt of its being based upon
intimate personal acquaintance. The poet must have
witnessed with his own eyes the change from majestic
indifference to bellicose frenzy described in the following
passage; he must have caught the greenish glare
of the oblique feline eyes, noted the preparatory tail-lashings,
and mentally photographed the crouching
attitude, and the yawn of deadly significance, that
preceded the fierce beast’s spring.</p>

<p class='c022'>And on the other side, the son of Peleus rushed to meet him,
like a lion, a ravaging lion whom men desire to slay, a whole
tribe assembled; and first he goeth his way unheeding, but
when some warrior-youth hath smitten him with a spear, then
he gathereth himself open-mouthed, and foam cometh forth
about his teeth, and his stout spirit groaneth in his heart, and
with his tail he scourgeth either side his ribs and flanks and
goadeth himself on to fight, and glaring is borne straight on
them by his passion to try whether he shall slay some man of
them, or whether himself shall perish in the forefront of the
throng.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c017'><b>[153]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Already, however, at the early epoch of the pile-built
villages by the lake of Constance, he had disappeared
from Western Europe; yet he lingered long
in Greece. Of his presence in the Peloponnesus only
legendary traces remain, although he figures largely
in Mycenæan art; but in Thrace he can lay claim to
an historically attested existence. Herodotus<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c017'><b>[160]</b></a> recounts
with wonder how the baggage-camels of Xerxes’
army were attacked by lions on the march from Acanthus
to Therma; and he defines the region haunted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>by them as bounded towards the east by the River
Nestus, on the west by the Achelous. Some Chalcidicean
coins, too, are stamped with the favourite oriental
device of a lion killing an ox; and Xenophon <i>possibly</i>—for
his expressions are dubious—includes the lion
among the wild fauna of Thrace. The statements,
on the other hand, of Polybius and Dio Chrysostom
leave no doubt that he had finally retreated from our
continent before the beginning of the Christian era.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c017'><b>[161]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>A Thessalian Homer might, then, quite conceivably,
have beheld an occasional predatory lion descending
the arbutus-clad slopes of Pelion or Olympus;
yet the continual allusions to leonine manners and
customs pervading the Iliad show an habitual acquaintance
with the animal which is certainly somewhat
surprising. It corresponds, nevertheless, quite
closely with the perpetual recurrence of his form in
the plastic representations of Mycenæ.</p>

<p class='c015'>The comparatively few Odyssean references to this
animal can scarcely be said to bear the stamp of visual
directness unmistakably belonging to those dispersed
broadcast through the earlier epic. Yet it would probably
be a mistake to suppose them derived at second-hand.
Without, then, denying that the author of the
Odyssey had actually ‘met the ravin lion when he
roared,’ we may express some wonder that he, like his
predecessor of the Iliad, left unrecorded the auditory
part of the resulting brain-impression. For the voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of the lion is assuredly the most imposing sound of
which animated nature seems capable. Casual allusions
to it in the Hymn to Aphrodite and in the
(nominally) Hesiodic ‘Shield of Hercules,’ are, nevertheless,
perhaps the earliest extant in Greek literature.</p>

<p class='c015'>The bear figures in the Iliad and Odyssey solely
as a constellation, except that a couple of verses interpolated
into the latter accord him a place among
the embossed decorations of the belt of Hercules.
The living animal, however, is still reported to lurk
in the ‘clov’n ravines’ of ‘many-fountain’d Ida,’ and,

strength and beauty, unsuspicious of the betrayal in

The ‘chafed boar’ in the Iliad either carries everything
before him, as Ajax scattered the Trojans fighting
round the body of Patroclus; or he dies, tracked
to his lair, if die he must, fearlessly facing his foes,
incarnating rage with bristles erected, blazing eyes,
and gnashing tusks. Nor was the upshot for him
inevitably fatal. Idomeneus of Crete, we are told,

<p class='c015'>The boar is a solitary animal. Like Hal o’ the
Wynd, he fights for his own right hand; and he was
accordingly appropriated by Homer to image the
valour of individual chiefs, while the rank and file
figure as wolves and jackals, hunting in packs,
pinched with hunger, bloodthirsty and desperately
eager, but formidable only collectively. Jackals still
abound in the Troad and throughout the Cyclades,
and their hideous wails and barkings enhance the
desolation of the Nauplian and Negropontine swamps.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c017'><b>[167]</b></a>
Neither have wolves disappeared from those regions;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>and the old dread of the animal which was at once
the symbol of darkness and of light, survives obscurely
to this day in the vampire-superstitions of
Eastern Europe. The closeness of the connexion
between vampires and were-wolves is shown by a
comparison of the modern Greek word <i>vrykolaka</i>,
vampire, with the Zend and Sanskrit <i>vehrka</i>, a wolf.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c017'><b>[168]</b></a>
Nor were the Greeks of classical times exempt from
the persuasion that men and wolves might temporarily,
or even permanently, exchange semblances.
Many stories of the kind were related in Arcadia in
connexion with the worship of the Lycæan Zeus; and
Pausanias, while critically sceptical as regards some
of these, was not too advanced a thinker to accept, as
fully credible, the penal transformation of Lycaon,
son of Pelasgus.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c017'><b>[169]</b></a> Such notions belonged, however, to
a rustic mythology of which Homer took small cognisance.
His thoughts travelled of themselves out
from the sylvan gloom of primeval haunts into the
open sunshine of unadulterated nature.</p>

<p class='c024'>he met with no bogey-animals. For him neither
beast nor bird had any mysterious significance. He
attributed to encounters with particular species no
influence, malefic or beneficial, upon human destiny.
Of themselves, they had, in his view, no concern with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>it, although ordinary animal instincts might, under
certain conditions, be so directed as to be expressive
to man of the will of the gods. In the Homeric
scheme, birds and serpents exclusively are so employed,
without, however, any departure from the order of
nature. Thus, by night near the sedgy Simoeis, a
heron, <i>Ardea nycticorax</i>, disturbed by the approach
of Odysseus and Diomed, assured them, by casually
flapping its way eastward, that their expedition had
the sanction of their guardian-goddess.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c017'><b>[170]</b></a> The choice
of the bird was plainly dictated by zoological considerations
alone; it had certainly no such recondite
motive as that suggested by Ælian,<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c017'><b>[171]</b></a> who, with almost
grotesque ingenuity, argued that the owl, as the fowl
of Athene’s special predilection, could only have been
deprived of the privilege of acting as her instrument
on the occasion through Homer’s consciousness of its
reputation as a bird of sinister augury—</p>

the conjuncture at which it was displayed. Hector,
relying upon what he took to be a promise of divine

rout of battle, of the Greek camp, and the conflagration
of the Greek ships. But every step in advance
brought him nearer to the tent where the irate epical
hero lay inert, but ready to spring into action at the
last extremity; and it was fully recognised that the
arming of Achilles meant far more than the mere loss
of the fruits of victory. The balance of events, then,
if the proposed <i>coup de main</i> were persevered with,
hung upon a knife-edge of destiny; and pale fear
might well invade the eager, yet hesitating Trojan
host when, just as the foremost warriors were about
to breach the Greek rampart, an eagle flying westward—that
is, towards the side of darkness and
death—let fall among their ranks a coiling and
blood-stained snake.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c017'><b>[172]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Magnificent, but, in the actual case, mistaken.
The shabby counsel of Polydamas really carried with
it the safety of Troy.</p>

<p class='c015'>The eagle is virtually the Homeric king of birds.
He is in the Iliad ‘the most perfect,’ as well as ‘the
strongest and swiftest of flying things’; his appearances
in both poems, often expressly ordained by
Zeus, are always momentous, and are, accordingly,
eagerly watched and solicitously interpreted; moreover,
they never deceive; to disregard the warning
they convey is to rush spontaneously to destruction.
It is only, however, in the Twenty-fourth Iliad, usually
regarded as subsequent, in point of composition, to
the cantos embodying the primitive legend of the
‘Wrath of Achilles,’ that the eagle begins to be
marked out as the special envoy of Zeus. Later, the
companionship became so close as to justify Æschylus
in implying that the bird was in lieu of a dog to the
‘father of gods and men.’ The position, on the other
hand, assigned, in one passage of the Odyssey, to the
hawk as the ‘swift messenger’ of Apollo, was not
maintained. The Hellenic Phœbus eventually disclaimed
all relationship with the hawk-headed Horus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>of the Nile Valley. The rapidity, however, of the
hawk’s flight, and his agility in the pursuit of his
prey, furnish our poet, again and again, with terms of
comparison. Here is an example, taken from the description
of the deadly duel outside the Scæan gate.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>As when a falcon, bird of swiftest flight,</div>

      <div class='line'>Swoops fiercely down; she, from beneath, in fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Evades the stroke; he, dashing through the brake,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shrill-shrieking, pounces on his destin’d prey;</div>
      <div class='line'>So, wing’d with desp’rate hate, Achilles flew,</div>
      <div class='line'>So Hector, flying from his keen pursuit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beneath the walls his active sinews plied.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c017'><b>[174]</b></a></div>

Homer’s falcon has no direct relations with light;

<p class='c015'>Vultures always lurk behind the scenes, as it were,
of the Homeric battle-stage. The abandonment to
their abhorrent offices of the bodies of the slain formed
one of the chief terrors of death in the field, and presented
a much-dreaded means of enhancing the penalties
of defeat. The carrion-feeding birds perpetually
on the watch to descend from the clouds upon the
blood-stained plain of Ilium, are clearly ‘griffon-vultures,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span><i>Vultur fulvus</i>; but the ‘bearded vulture,’ <i>Gypaëtus
barbatus</i>, the <i>Lämmergeier</i> of the Germans,
which, like the eagle, pursues live prey, occasionally
lends, in a figure, the swoop and impetus of its flight
to vivify some incident of extermination.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c017'><b>[176]</b></a> Both species

‘prudent crane’ was steered during three thousand

as too childish for the mature taste of his Roman

obscure rumours concerning the stunted races encountered
by modern travellers in Central Africa.
The association of ideas, however, by which they were
connected in a hostile sense with ‘fowls o’ the air’ is
of trackless antiquity. It partially survives in the
notion, current in Finland, that birds of passage

<p class='c015'>Intense appreciation of the sentiment of sound is
here unmistakable; yet elsewhere in the Homeric
poems we hear of the sharp cry of the swallow, of the
screams of contending vultures, the piercing shriek of
the eagle, the wild pæan of the hawk, the clamorous
vociferations of his terrified victims, but nothing of
the tender notes of thrush, lark, or linnet, though
deliciously audible throughout Greece</p>

<p class='c024'>Even in the island of Calypso, where delights are
imaginable at will, the poplars and cypresses house
only such harsh-voiced birds as owls, hawks, and
cormorants—perhaps in order to leave the uncontested
palm for sweet singing to the nymph herself.
The power of song does not, indeed, appear to be, in
Homer’s view, ‘an excellent thing in woman.’ It is
not included among the gifts of Athene, or even
among the graces of Aphrodite. None of his noble or
admirable heroines possess it. It is reserved, as part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of a baleful dower of fascination, for enchantresses
who lure men to oblivion or ruin—for Calypso, Circe,
and the Sirens.</p>
<p class='c015'>The Odyssey being essentially a sea-story, the
prevalence in its fauna of marine species is not surprising.
Seals frequently present themselves; coots
and cormorants, laughing gulls and sea-mews, dive
and play amid the surges that beat upon its magic
shores; ospreys call and cry; a cuttle-fish is limned
to the life; Scylla has been supposed to represent a
magnified and monstrous cephalopod. Dolphins are
common to the Iliad and Odyssey, and frequent the
Ægean nowadays as of old.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c017'><b>[187]</b></a> Their mythical associations
in post-Homeric literature are, indeed, forgotten;
but the direction in which they travel, collected

Melos to a rude forecast of the set of impending
winds.</p>

<p class='c015'>The only significant zoological novelty, then, in
the Odyssey may be said to lie in its recognition of
the goose as a domesticated bird. The prominence
given by it to swine-keeping, only incidentally mentioned
in the Iliad, is also noteworthy. A dissimilarity,
on the other hand, in the ethical sentiment
towards animals displayed in the two poems—above
all, as regards the horse and dog—cannot fail to
strike a dispassionate reader; but this has been
sufficiently dwelt upon in a separate chapter. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>remark need only here be added that the conception
of the dog Argos seems no less thoroughly European
than that of the horses of Rhesus is Asiatic. Both,
it is true, may have had a local origin on the same
side of the Hellespont, but, from the point of view of
moral geography, they undoubtedly belong to different
continents.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>If</span> we can accept as tolerably complete the view of
early Achæan beliefs presented to us in the Iliad and
Odyssey, they included but few legendary associations
with vegetable growths. The treatment of the
Homeric flora, like that of the Homeric fauna, is
essentially simple and direct. One magic herb has a
place in it, and the ‘enchanted stem’ of the lotus
bears fruit of inexplicable potency over the subtly
compounded human organism; but tree-worship is as
remote from the poet’s thoughts as animal-worship,
and flower-myths seem equally beyond his ken. He
knew of no ‘love-lies-bleeding’ stories interpreting
the passionate glow of scarlet petals; nor of ‘forget-me-not’
stories fitted to the more tender sentiment of
azure blooms; nor of delicate calyxes nurtured by
goddesses’ tears; nor of any other of the wistful
human fancies endlessly intertwined with the beautiful
starry apparitions of spring-tide on the blossoming
earth. The simplicity of his admiration for them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>might, indeed, almost have incurred the disapprobation
of ultra-Wordsworthians. With the ‘yellow
primrose’ he never had an opportunity of making
acquaintance, by ‘the river’s brim’ or elsewhere;
but crocuses or hyacinths, violets or poppies, drew
him into no reveries; no mystical meanings clung
about the images of them in his mind; he looked at
them with open eyes of delight, and went his way.</p>

<p class='c015'>The oak has been called the king of the forest, as
the lion the king of beasts. But its supremacy is
largely a thing of the past. To the early undivided
Aryans, it was the tree of trees. Their common name
for it, which survived with its original special meaning
in Celtic and Greek, came, in other languages, to
denote the generalised conception of a tree, showing
the oak to have been pre-eminent in their common
ancestral home. Traces of this shifting of the linguistic
standpoint are preserved in some Homeric
phrases. Thus, <i>drûs</i>—etymologically identical with
the English <i>tree</i>—means, not only an oak, but, most
probably, the particular kind of oak familiar to us
in England—<i>Quercus robur</i>, ‘the unwedgeable and
gnarled oak’ of Shakespeare. But the generic significance
gradually infused into the specific term
comes to the front in several of its compounds. A
wood-cutter, for instance, is, in the Iliad, literally an
‘oak-cutter,’ and the ‘solemn shade’ round Circe’s
dwelling was afforded, etymologically, by an oaken
grove, although the meaning really conveyed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>word <i>drûma</i> was that of a collection of forest-trees of
undetermined and various kinds. In later Greek, too,
we find a woodpecker styled an ‘oakpecker’; and
the Dryades, while in name ‘oak-nymphs,’ were, in
point of fact, unrestricted in their choice of an arboreal
dwelling-place. By a curious survival of associations,
the name in modern Greek of this antique
forest-constituent is <i>dendron</i>, a tree; yet it is now by
no means common in Greece. Homer’s oaks were
mountain-reared, sturdy, proof against most contingencies
of climate. Of similar nature were Leonteus
and Polypœtes, of the rugged Lapith race, who indomitably
held the way into the Greek camp against
the mighty Asius. ‘These twain,’ we are told, ‘stood
in front of the lofty gates, like high-crested oak-trees
in the hills, that for ever abide the wind and rain,
firm fixed with roots great and long.’<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c017'><b>[188]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f188'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r188'>188</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Iliad</i>, xii. 131-34.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The species of oak at present dominant both in
Greece and the Troad is the ‘oak of Bashan,’ <i>Quercus
ægilops</i>. Its fruit, the valonia in commercial demand
for tanning purposes, was made serviceable, within
Homer’s experience, under the almost identical name
of <i>balanoi</i>, only as food for pigs. Homer’s name for
this fine tree—extended, perhaps, to the closely allied
<i>Quercus esculus</i>—is <i>phegos</i>, signifying ‘edible,’ and
denoting, in other European languages, the beech.
How, then, did it come to be transferred, south of the
Ceraunian mountains, to a totally different kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>tree? The explanation is simple. No beeches grew
in the Hellenic peninsula when the first Aryan settlers
entered it. A word was hence left derelict, and was
naturally claimed by a conspicuous forest-tree, until
then anonymous, because unknown further north,
which shared with the beech its characteristic quality—so
the necessities of hunger caused it to be esteemed—of
producing fruit capable, after a fashion, of supporting
life.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c017'><b>[189]</b></a> So, in the United States, the English
names ‘robin,’ ‘hemlock,’ ‘maple,’ and probably many
others, were unceremoniously handed on to strange
species, on the strength of some casual or superficial
resemblances.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c017'><b>[190]</b></a> The tradition of acorn-eating connected
with the rustic Arcadians applied evidently to
the fruit of the valonia-oak, or one of its nearest
congeners;<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c017'><b>[191]</b></a> and the oracular oak of Dodona, to
which Odysseus pretended to have hied for counsel,
appears to have been of the same description; as was
certainly the tree of Zeus before the Scæan gate,
whence Apollo and Athene watched the single combat
between Hector and Ajax, and beneath which the
spear of Tlepolemus was wrenched from the flesh of
the fainting Sarpedon. These two are the only trees
divinely appropriated in Homeric verse, and they command
but a small share of the reverence paid by Celts
and Teutons to their sacred oaks.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>The beech is an encroaching tree. Wherever it is
capable of thriving, it tends to replace the oak, which
has lost, apparently, a great part of its old propagative
energy. Possibly its exposure to the attacks of
countless insect-enemies, from which the beech enjoys
immunity, may account for its comparative helplessness
in the battle for life. The beech is, at any rate,
now the typical tree of central Europe; it has aided
in the extirpation of the ancient oak-forests of Jutland,
and has established itself, within the historic period,
in Scotland and Ireland.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c017'><b>[192]</b></a> Its habitat is, however,
bounded to the east by a line drawn from Königsberg
on the Baltic to the Caucasus; it is not found in the
Troad, or in Greece south of a track crossing the
peninsula from the Gulf of Arta to the Gulf of Volo.
It grows freely, however, on the slopes of the Mysian
Olympus, as well as on Mount Pelion in Thessaly.
At the beginning of the Macedonian era, too, Dicæarchus<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c017'><b>[193]</b></a>
described the thick foliage of Pelion as prevalently
beechen, though cypresses, silver firs, junipers,
and maples, also abounded, the last three kinds of tree
having since disappeared, while the beech seems to have
only just held its ground.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c017'><b>[194]</b></a> Its relative importance,
then, five hundred years earlier, is not likely to have
been very different; yet Homer, who certainly knew a
good deal about Pelion, whether by report, or from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>observation, never mentions the beech. It is true
that we cannot argue with any confidence from omission
to ignorance. An epic is not an encyclopædia.
The illustrations employed in it are not necessarily
exhaustive of all that the poet’s world contains. We
can, then, be certain of nothing more than that
Homer’s idea of a typical forest did not include the
beech. Its appearance, then, in the following spirited
lines from Mr. Way’s excellent translation of the Iliad,
has no warrant in the original, where the third kind
of tree mentioned is the <i>phegos</i>, or valonia-oak.</p>

<p class='c015'>The ash, on the other hand, though abundant on
many Greek mountains, no longer waves along the
ridgy heights of Pelion. Yet it was here that the
ashen shaft of the great Pelidean spear was cut by the
Centaur Chiron. For in the Homeric account of the
arming of Patroclus, after we have been told of his
equipment with the shield, cuirass, and formidably
nodding helmet of Achilles, it is recounted:</p>

<p class='c022'>Then seized he two strong lances that fitted his grasp, only
he took not the spear of the noble son of Aiakos, heavy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>huge, and stalwart, that none other of the Achaians could wield,
but Achilles alone availed to wield it: even the ashen Pelian
spear that Chiron gave to his father dear, from the crown of
Pelion, to be the bane of heroes.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c017'><b>[196]</b></a></p>
<p class='c024'>The shaft in question could certainly have been hewn
nowhere else; the fact of the Centaur’s residence
being attested, to this day, by the visibility of the
cavern inhabited by him, dilapidated, it is true,
but undeniable.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c017'><b>[197]</b></a> Here, surely, is evidence to convince
the most sceptical. Its conclusive force is scarcely
inferior to that of the testimony borne by the graves
of Hamlet and Ophelia at Elsinore to the reality of
the tragic endings of those distraught personages.</p>

clothing of all the heights and hollows of Chiron’s
mountain with beech and oak, chestnut and plane-trees,

<p class='c015'>In the Iliad and Odyssey, too, pine-wood is the
approved material for nautical constructions. It was
probably derived from the mountain-loving silver-fir,
some grand specimens of which grew nevertheless conveniently
near the sea-shore in remote Ogygia, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>provided ‘old Laertes’ son’ with material for his
rapidly and skilfully built raft. Homer distinguishes,
in a loose way, at least two species of pine, but their
identification in particular cases is to a great extent
arbitrary. The trees, for instance, employed in conjunction
with ‘high-crested’ oaks, to fence round the
court-yard of Polyphemus, may have been the picturesque
stonepines of South Italy, but they may just
as well, or better, have been maritime pines, such as
spring up everywhere along the sandy flats of modern
Greece.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c017'><b>[200]</b></a> The stone-pine was sacred to Cybele.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c017'><b>[201]</b></a> Her
husband, Atys, was transformed into one, with the
result of bringing her as near the verge of madness
as might be consistent with her venerable dignity;
for actually bereft of reason a goddess presumably
cannot be. This, however, was a post-Homeric legend,
and a post-Homeric association.</p>

<p class='c015'>What might be called the ornamental part of the
Ogygian groves consisted of black poplars, aromatic
cypresses, and alders. Indigenous there, likewise,
although heard of only as supplying perfumed firewood,
were the ‘cedar’ and ‘<i>thuon</i>,’ split logs of
which blazed within the fragrant cavern where
Calypso was found by Hermes tunefully singing while
she plied the shuttle. The cedar here mentioned,
however, was no ‘cedar of Lebanon,’ but a description
of juniper which attains the full dimensions of a tree

wood yielded by it was highly valued by the Homeric
Greeks for its ‘grateful smell’; store-rooms for
precious commodities, and the ‘perfumed apartments’
of noble ladies were constructed of it. This, at least,
is expressly stated of Hecuba’s chamber, and can be
inferred of Helen’s and Penelope’s. The <i>thuon</i>, or
‘wood of sacrifice,’ burnt with cedar-wood on Calypso’s
hearth, was identified by Pliny with the African
<i>citrus</i>, extravagantly prized for decorative furniture
in Imperial Rome, and thought to be represented by
a coniferous tree called <i>Thuya articulata</i>, now met

owing to a supposed incapacity for ripening fruit.
The grove in question was composed of ‘lofty poplars’

were alike deemed sterile and, because sterile,
of evil omen.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c017'><b>[205]</b></a> Even among ourselves, the willow

with Hades, in the traditions of historic Greece, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>less explicit than that of the white poplar (<i>Populus

its especial habitat on the shores of the Acheron in
Thesprotia, whence, as Pausanias relates,<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c017'><b>[207]</b></a> it was
brought to the Peloponnesus by Hercules; and the
same hero, in a variant of the story, returned crowned
with poplar from his successful expedition to Hades.
In the Odyssey the white poplar does not occur, and
in the Iliad only in a simile employed to render more
impressive, first the collapse of Asius under the stroke
of Idomeneus, and again the overthrow of Sarpedon
by Patroclus. ‘And he fell, as an oak falls, or a

<p class='c024'>is the literary embodiment of this popular idea. Evidently,
then, the trees of mourning in the Iliad and
Odyssey were singled out owing to their possession of
a common, though by no means obvious peculiarity;
yet their selection in each poem is different. This is
the more remarkable because associations of the sort,
once established, are almost ineradicable from what
we may call tribal consciousness. Cypresses have
no share in them, so far as Homer is concerned.
Their appointment to the office of mourning the dead
would seem to have been subsequently resolved upon.
The connexion was, at any rate, well established
before the close of the classic age, when funeral-pyres
were made by preference of cypress wood, the
tree itself being consecrated to the hated Dis.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c017'><b>[211]</b></a> And
Pausanias met with groves of cypresses surrounding

famous stream, once choked with Trojan dead, are
fringed—Dr. Virchow relates—with double rows of
willows intermixed with tamarisks and young elms.
If no such robust trunk is now to be seen as that of
the elm-tree, by the help of which Achilles struggled
out of the raging torrent, the deficiency is accidental,
not inherent. Potential trees are kept perpetually in

the Asmak, dense growths of asphodel send up flower-stalks

fields are sheeted white with the blossoms of the
water-ranunculus; the ‘flowery Scamandrian plain’
that gladdened the eyes of the ancient bard is still
visibly spread out before the traveller of to-day.
Homer, indeed, as Dr. Virchow remarks, knew a good
deal more about the Troad than most of his critics,
even if he did, on occasions, subordinate topographical
accuracy to poetical exigency.</p>

<p class='c015'>The plane-tree nowhere shows to more splendid
advantage than in Greece and Asia Minor; but the
only specimen commemorated in the Greek epics
grew at Aulis, and sheltered the altar upon which the
hecatombs of the expeditionary force were offered
during the time of waiting terminated by the sacrifice
of Iphigenia. It was the scene, too, of a portent;
for one day, in full view of the astonished Achæans, a
serpent crept up its trunk to devour the nine callow
inmates of a sparrow’s nest among its branches, and
on the completion of a sufficiently ample meal by the
deglutition of the mother-bird, was then and there
turned into stone.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c017'><b>[215]</b></a> The decade of consumed sparrows—mother
and chicks—signified, according to the interpretation
of Calchas, the ten years of the siege of
Troy; and the reality of the event was attested to later
generations by the display, in the temple of Artemis
at Aulis, of some wood from the identical tree within

<p class='c015'>The legendary plane-tree had, however, when
Pausanias visited Aulis, been replaced by a group of
palms imported from Syria, the nearest home of the
species, whence the Phœnicians had not failed to
transport it westward. It accordingly, as being derived
from the same prolific source of novelties, shared
the name ‘Phœnix’ with the brilliant colour produced
by the Tyrian dye. But its introduction seems to
belong to the later Achæan age. For the palm is unknown
in the Iliad, and emerges only once in the
Odyssey,<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c017'><b>[217]</b></a> although then with particular emphasis.
The individual tree seen by Homer was probably the
first planted on Greek soil. It spread its crown of
leaves above the shrine of Apollo, at Delos. And when
the storm-tossed Odysseus set his wits to work to win
the protection of Nausicaa—a matter of life or death
to him at the moment—he could think of no more
flattering comparison for the youthful stateliness of
her aspect, than to the vivid upspringing grace of the
tall, arboreal exotic. A tradition, not reported by
Homer, who nowhere localises the birth of a god,
asserted Apollo to have come into the world beneath
that very tree, or one of its predecessors in the same
spot; and it still had successors in the Augustan age.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c017'><b>[218]</b></a></p>

regions of the Homeric world. The entrance to the
cavern of Polyphemus was shaded by its foliage, not
as yet sacred to the sun-god. Equally detached from
relationship to Athene is the olive, with which, however,
acquaintance is implied both in its wild and
cultivated varieties. The latter Pindar asserts to
have been introduced into his native country, from
the ‘dark sources of the Ister,’ by Hercules,<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c017'><b>[219]</b></a> who
showed unexpected skill in the difficult art of acclimatisation;
and the value in which it was held can

<p class='c022'>As when a man reareth some lusty sapling of an olive in a
clear space where water springeth plenteously, a goodly shoot
fair-growing; and blasts of all winds shake it, yet it bursteth
into white blossom; then suddenly cometh the wind of a great
hurricane and wresteth it out of its abiding-place and stretcheth
it out upon the earth; even so lay Panthoös’ son, Euphorbos of
the good ashen spear, when Menelaos, Atreus’ son, had slain
him, and despoiled him of his arms.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c017'><b>[220]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Olive-wood was the favourite material for axe-handles

the bay where Odysseus landed after his long wanderings,
was ‘wide-spreading’ in point of simple fact,
needing no poetical licence to make it so. Olive-oil
does not appear to have been then in culinary employment;
its chief use was for anointing the body after
bathing. This indispensable luxury was provided
for, in opulent establishments, by laying up a goodly
stock of oil among such household treasures as were
entrusted by Penelope to the care of Eurycleia.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c017'><b>[223]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The Homeric poems contain no allusion to the
perfume of either flowers or fruit. This is the more
surprising from the extreme sensitiveness betrayed
in them to olfactory impressions of other kinds. We
hear of ‘scented apartments,’ ‘sweet-smelling garments,’
of the aromatic quality of the cypress, of the
spicy air wafted through Calypso’s island from the
juniper and citron-logs serving her for fuel, even of
the barely appreciable fragrance of olive-oil. Offensive
odours excite corresponding horror. Menelaus and
his comrades were utterly unable to endure, without
the solace of an ambrosial antidote, the ‘ancient and
fish-like smell’ of the sealskins disguised in which
they lay in wait for Proteus, under the tutelary
guidance of the sea-nymph Eidothea, his scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>dutiful daughter. The Spartan king, relating the
incident to Telemachus, was confident of meeting
with fellow-feeling when he said:</p>

<p class='c022'>There would our ambush have been most terrible, for the
deadly stench of the sea-bred seals distressed us sore; nay, who
would lay him down by a beast of the sea? But herself she
wrought deliverance, and devised a great comfort. She took
ambrosia of a very sweet savour, and set it beneath each man’s
nostril, and did away with the stench of the beast.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c017'><b>[224]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>As we read, the tradition that Homer’s last days
were prolonged by the perfume of an apple, grows
intelligible. And yet the balmy breath of Pierian
violets and Cilician crocuses drew no comment from
him!</p>

<p class='c015'>The flowers distinctively noticed by him are:
poppies, hyacinths, crocuses, violets, and, by implication,
roses and white lilies. And it is somewhat remarkable
that, while all the items of this not very
long list can be collected from the Iliad, only two of
them recur in any shape in the Odyssey. The former
poem recognises the artificial cultivation of the poppy,
probably, as we shall see, for gastronomic purposes,
since there could be no question at that epoch, in
Greece or Asia Minor, of the preparation of opium.
The death, by an arrow-shot from the bow of Teucrus,
of the youthful Gorgythion, son of Priam and Castianeira,
is thus described.</p>

<p class='c022'>Even as in a garden a poppy droopeth its head aside, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>heavy with fruit and the showers of spring, so bowed he aside

<p class='c015'>Crimson poppies now bloom freely along the

<p class='c015'>Mount Gargarus, the loftiest peak of Ida, blossomed,
according to the Iliad, with hyacinths, crocuses,
and lotus. This last term designates, however, not
the lily of the Nile, but a kind of clover, much
relished by the steeds, not only of heroic, but of
immortal owners. The fragrant yellow flowers borne
by it are not expressly adverted to; the function of
the Homeric lotus-grass was rather to supply herbage
than to evoke delight.</p>

<p class='c015'>The identification of the hyacinth of Mount Ida
has employed much learning and ingenuity, and the
result of learned discussions is not always unanimity
of opinion. The case in point is indeed very nearly
one of <i>quot homines, tot sententiæ</i>. The gladiolus,
larkspur, iris, the Martagon lily, the common hyacinth,
have all had advocates, each of whom considers his
case to be of convincing, not to say, of irresistible
strength. The last-mentioned and most obvious solution
of the problem is that favoured by Buchholz,<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c017'><b>[227]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>and he supports it with the reasonable surmise that
the epithet ‘hyacinthine,’ applied to the locks of Odysseus,
referred, not to colour, but to form, their
closely-set curls recalling forcibly enough the <i>ringleted</i>
effect of the congregated flowerets. The dry
soil of Greece is particularly suitable to the hyacinth,
sundry kinds of which—one of them so deeply blue
as to be nearly black—are found all over the Peloponnesus,
in the Ionian islands, and high up on
the outlying bulwarks of Olympus.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c017'><b>[228]</b></a> The ‘flower of

the death of Hyacinthus; and it was probably identical
with the scarlet gladiolus (<i>Gladiolus byzantinus</i>),
almost certainly with the <i>suave rubens hyacinthus</i> of
the Third Eclogue, but not with the Homeric hyacinth,
which is undistinguished in folk-lore.</p>

<p class='c015'>The ‘violet-crowned’ Athenians of old, could they
recross the Styx to wander by the Ilissus, would be
struck with at least one unwelcome change. For
violets no longer grow in Attica. They are nevertheless
found, although sparingly, in most other parts
of Greece, and up to an elevation of two thousand
feet on the slopes of Parnassus. Homer often mentions
them allusively, but introduces them directly
only once, and then, as Fraas has remarked, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the incongruous company of the marsh-loving wild
parsley (<i>Apium palustre</i>).<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c017'><b>[230]</b></a> Unjustifiable from a botanical
point of view, the conjunction may have had
an æsthetic motive. In the festal garlands of classic
Greece, violets and parsley were commonly associated,
and their association was perhaps dictated by a survival
of the taste displayed in the embellishment of
Calypso’s well-watered meadow.</p>

<p class='c015'>Homeric violets, at any rate, flourished nowhere
else ostensibly; but from their modest retirement
within the poet’s mind supplied him with a colour-epithet,
which he employed, one might make bold to
say, without over-nice discrimination. The sea might
indeed, under certain aspects, be fitly so described;
but iron makes a very distant approach to the hue
indicated; and Nature must have been in her most
sportive mood when she clothed the flock of Polyphemus
in violet fleeces. Polyphemus, to be sure,
lived in a semi-fabulous world, where it has been suggested<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c017'><b>[231]</b></a>
that wool might conceivably <i>grow dyed</i>, as in
the restored Saturnian kingdom imagined by Virgil;<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c017'><b>[232]</b></a>
and the dark-blue material attached to Helen’s golden
distaff<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c017'><b>[233]</b></a> was evidently a far-travelled rarity, such as
might be produced by the use of a foreign dye. But
there is no evidence of primitive acquaintance with a
blue dye; indeed, if one had been known, it is practically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>certain that the colour due to it would have
been named, either, like indigo, from the substance
affording it, or, like ‘Tyrian’ purple, from its place of
origin. The hue of the violet, however, as it appeared
to Homer, does not bear to be more distinctly defined
than as dusky, while with Virgil it was frankly <i>black</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>The crocus of Mount Ida—the crocus that ‘brake
like fire’ at the feet of the three Olympian competitors
for the palm of beauty—was the splendid golden
flower (<i>Crocus sativus</i>) yielding, through its orange-coloured
stigmas, a dye once deemed magnificent, a
perfume ranked amongst the choicest luxuries of Rome,
and a medicine in high ancient and mediæval repute.
But its vogue has passed. Saffron slippers are no
longer an appanage of supreme dignity; the ‘saffron
wings’ of Iris are folded; the ‘saffron robes’ of the
Dawn retain the glamour only of what they signify;
to the chymist and the cook, the antique floral ingredient,
so long and so extravagantly prized, is of very
subordinate importance.</p>

<p class='c015'>Both the word ‘crocus’ and its later equivalent
‘saffron,’ are of Semitic origin. Witness the Hebrew
form <i>karkom</i> of the first,<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c017'><b>[234]</b></a> the Arabic <i>sahafaran</i> of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>second, developed out of <i>assfar</i>, yellow, and represented
by the Spanish <i>azafran</i>, whence our ‘saffron.’
The plant was widely and profitably cultivated under
Moorish rule in Spain, and was probably introduced
by the Phœnicians into Greece, though the common
vernal crocus is certainly indigenous there, its white
and purple cups begemming all the declivities of
‘Hellas and Argos.’ The saffron-crocus, too, now
grows wild in such dry and chalky soil as Sunium
and Hymettus afford;<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c017'><b>[235]</b></a> yet its name betrays its
foreign affinities. Saffron-tinted garments had perhaps
never, down to Homer’s time, been seen in
Greece itself; he was beyond doubt unacquainted
with the actual use of the dye, and distributed with
the utmost parsimony the splendour conferred by it.
Not only were mere mortals excluded from a share in
it, neither Hecuba nor Helen owning a crocus-bordered
peplos, but none such set off the formidable
charms of the goddess-hostesses of Odysseus, in the
fairy isles where he lingered, home-sick amid strange
luxury. Saffron robes are, in fact, assigned by the
poet of the Iliad, exclusively to Eos, the Dawn, while
in the Odyssey, the crocus is never referred to, directly
or indirectly.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>crocus-coloured tresses came poetically into fashion.
The daughters of Celeus, in the Hymn to Demeter,
were endowed with them; Ariadne at Naxos, too,
besides other mythical maidens. And Roman ladies
realised the idea of employing saffron as a hair-dye, the
stern disapproval of Tertullian and Saint Jerome notwithstanding.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c017'><b>[236]</b></a>
The scent of the crocus was made
part of the pleasures of the amphitheatre by the diffusion
among the audience of saffron-wine in the finest
possible spray, and Heliogabalus habitually bathed in
saffron-water. The flower, too, was noted by Pliny
with the rose, lily, and violet, for its delicious fragrance,<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c017'><b>[237]</b></a>
Homer’s apparent insensibility to which may
well suggest a doubt whether, after all, he knew the
late-blooming, golden crocus otherwise than by reputation.</p>

<p class='c015'>As regards the rose and the lily, the doubt becomes
wellnigh certainty. Both gave rise to Homeric epithets;
neither takes in the Homeric poems a concrete
form. The Iranic derivation of their Greek names,
<i>rhodon</i> and <i>leirion</i>, shows the native home of each of
these matchless blossoms to have been in Persia.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c017'><b>[238]</b></a>
Thence, according to M. Hehn, they travelled through
Armenia and Phrygia into Thrace, and eventually, by
that circuitous route, reached Greece proper. Commemorative
myths strewed the track of their progressive
transmissions. Thus, the mountain Rhodope in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Thrace took its name from a ‘rosy-footed’ attendant
upon Persephone, in the ‘crocus-purple hour’ of her
capture by ‘gloomy Dis;’ and in the same vicinity
were located the Nysæan Fields—the scene of the
disaster—then, for a snare of enticement to the
damsel, ablaze with roses and lilies, ‘a marvel to
behold,’ with narcissus, crocuses, violets, and hyacinths.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c017'><b>[239]</b></a>
Moreover, roses, each with sixty leaves, and
highly perfumed, were said to blossom spontaneously
in the Emathian gardens of King Midas;<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c017'><b>[240]</b></a> Theophrastus
places near Philippi the original habitat of
the hundred-leaved rose; and roses were profusely
employed in the rites of Phrygian nature-worship.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dim rumours of their loveliness spread among
the Homeric Greeks. The standing Odyssean designation
of Eos as ‘rosy-fingered,’ alternating, in
the Iliad, with ‘saffron-robed,’ heralded, it might be
said, the European advent of the flower itself. For
rose-gardens can have lain only just below the Homeric
horizon. Their ambrosial products did not
indeed come within mortal reach, but were at the disposal
of the gods. By the application of oil of roses,
Aphrodite kept the body of Hector fresh and fair
during the twelve days of its savage maltreatment by
Achilles; and oil of roses was later an accredited
antiseptic. Archilochus seems to have been the first
Greek poet to make living acquaintance with the
blushing flower of Dionysus and Aphrodite, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>became known likewise only to the writers of the later
books of Scripture. The ‘Rose of Sharon’ is accordingly
believed to have been a narcissus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Allusions to the lily do not occur in the Odyssey,
and are vague and ill-defined in the Iliad. The flesh
of Ajax might intelligibly, if not appropriately, be
designated ‘lily-like’; but the same term applied to
sounds conveys little or no meaning to our minds.
Even if we admit a far-fetched analogy between the
song of the Muses, as something uncommon and
tenderly beautiful, and a fragile white flower, we have
to confess ourselves bewildered by the extension of
the comparison to the shrill voices of cicadas, rasping
out their garrulous contentment amidst summer
foliage.</p>

<p class='c015'>The slenderness, then, of Homer’s acquaintance
with the finer kinds of bloom introduced gradually
from the East, is apparent from his seeming ignorance
of their ravishing perfumes, no less than from the
inadequacy of his hints as to their beauty of form and
colour. His love of flowers was in the instinctive
stage; it had not come to the maturity of self-consciousness.
They obtained recognition from him
neither as symbols of feeling, nor as accessories to
enjoyment. Nausicaa wove no garlands; the cultivation
of flowers in the gardens of Alcinous is left
doubtful; Laertes pruned his pear-trees, and dug
round his vines, but reared for his solace not so much
as a poppy. No display of living jewellery aided the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>seductions of Circe’s island; Calypso was content to
plant the unpretending violet; Aphrodite herself was
without a floral badge; floral decorations of every
kind were equally unthought of. Flowers, in fact,
had not yet been brought within the sphere of human
sentiment; they had not yet acquired significance as
emblems of human passion; they had not yet been
made partners with humanity in the sorrows of death,
and the transient pleasures of a troubled and ephemeral
existence.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Heroic</span> appetites were strong and simple. They
craved ‘much meat,’ and could be completely appeased
with nothing else; but they demanded little
more. They needed no savoury caresses or spicy
blandishments. Occasion indeed to stimulate them
there was none, though much difficulty might arise
about satisfying them. For they disdained paltry
subterfuges. Fish, game, and vegetables they accepted
in lieu of more substantial prey; but under
protest. Hunger, in consenting to receive such trifles,
merely compounded for a partial settlement of her
claim.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Homeric bill of fare was concise, and admitted
of slight diversification. Day after day, and at meal
after meal, roast meat, bread, and wine were set
before perennially eager guests, in whose esteem any
fundamental change in the materials of the banquet
would certainly have been for the worse. Variety, in
fact, was in the inverse ratio of abundance. Want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>alone counselled departures from the beaten track
of opulent feasting, and compelled the reluctant
adoption of inadequate expedients for silencing the
imperative outcries of famine. Nevertheless it cannot
be supposed that the epical setting forth of
Achæan culinary resources was as exhaustive as the
menu of a Guildhall dinner. For where would be
the ‘swiftness’ of a narrative which could not leave
so much as a dish of beans to the imagination?
Homeric criticism is indeed everywhere complicated
by the necessity of admitting wide gaps of silence;
and in this particular department, so much evidently
remains in those gaps, that our list of comestibles
must be to a great extent inferential.</p>

<p class='c015'>‘Butcher’s meat’ (as we call it) was the staple
food of Greek heroes. Oxen, however, were not recklessly
slaughtered. ‘Great meals of beef’ usually
honoured solemn occasions. The fat beasts, reckoned
to be in their prime at five years old, met their fate
for the most part in connexion with some expiatory
ceremony, as that employed to stay the pestilence in
the First Iliad, or as the sacrifice for victory offered
by Agamemnon in the Second Iliad. The gods were
then served first with tit-bits wrapped in fat, and
reduced by fire to ashes and steamy odours, peculiarly
grateful to immortal nostrils. Portions of the
haunches were often chosen for this purpose; the
tongue might be added; while at other times,
samples of the whole carcass at large seemed preferable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>What remained was cut up into small pieces
after a fashion still prevailing in Albania,<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c017'><b>[241]</b></a> and these,
having been filed upon spits, were rapidly grilled.
Thickly strewn with barley-meal, they were then
distributed by a steward, and eaten with utensils of
nature’s providing. Specially honoured guests had
pieces from the chine—‘<i>perpetui tergo bovis</i>’—allotted
to them; and they might, if they chose, share their
‘booty’ (so it was designated) with any other to
whom they desired to pass on the compliment, as
Odysseus did to Demodocus at the Phæacian feast.
The glad recipients of these greasy favours were
obviously exempt from modern fastidiousness.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Sheep and goats were prepared for table precisely
in the same way with oxen, and so likewise were
pigs, save that they were not divested of their skins.
‘Cracklings’ were already appreciated. Roast pork
appears, in the Iliad, only on the hospitable board
of Achilles; but is less exclusively apportioned
in the Odyssey. A brace of sucking-pigs were instantly
killed and cooked by Eumæus, the swineherd
of Odysseus, on the arrival of his disguised
master. Yet he was very far from estimating at
their true value the tender merits of the dish
celebrated by Elia as perfectly ‘satisfactory to the
criticalness of the censorious palate,’ actually apologising
for it as ‘servants’ fare,’ wholly unacceptable
to the haughty Suitors, for whose profuse entertainment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>a full-grown porker had to be daily sacrificed.
Each man, however, despatched his pig, and was
shortly ready for more. And so captivated was
Eumæus, by the time his four underlings returned
from the fields for supper, with his outwardly sorry
guest, that, enlarging the bounds of his liberality, he
ordered the slaughter of a noble hog, whose adipose
perfections had been ripening during full five years of
life. His cooking was promptly executed, and one
share having been set aside for the local nymphs, the
six men fell to, and left only such scraps as served
for an early breakfast next morning. The performance
would have been creditable in modern Somaliland.</p>

<p class='c015'>Every Homeric hero was an accomplished butcher,
and no despicable cook. Both offices were, indeed, too
closely connected with religious ritual to have any
note of degradation attached to them. Thus, animals
were habitually understood to be ‘sacrificed,’ not
killed in the purely carnal sense, and the preparation
of their flesh for table was formalised as part of the
ceremony of worship. The Suitors were marked out
as a reckless and impious crew by discarding all
sacerdotal functions from their meal-time operations;
yet they reserved to themselves, as if it belonged to
their superior station, the pleasing duty of cutting
the throats of the beasts they were about to devour,
passing with the least possible delay from the shambles
to the banqueting-hall.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Homeric culinary art perhaps really covered a
wider range than is attributed to it in the Poems,
where it is designedly represented under a quasi-ritualistic
aspect. Although meat, for instance, so
far as can be learned from direct statement, was
invariably roast or grilled, it by no means follows
that it was never eaten boiled or stewed. The contrary
inference is indeed fairly warranted by the
frequent conjunction of pots, water, and fire; and was
thought by Athenæus to derive support from the use
as a missile, aimed at Odysseus in unprovoked savagery
by Ctesippus, one of the Suitors, of an ox’s foot,
which happened to be lying conveniently at hand in a
bread-basket.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c017'><b>[242]</b></a> For who, asked the gastronomical
sophist, ever thought of roasting an ox’s foot?<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c017'><b>[243]</b></a> The
casual display, too, in a simile of the Iliad, of a
caldron of boiling lard,<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c017'><b>[244]</b></a> assures us that some kind of
frying process was familiar to the poet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the few secondary articles of diet specified
by him was a sausage-like composition, of so irredeemably
coarse a character, that ‘ears polite’ cannot
fail to be offended at its literal description. It
consisted, to speak plainly, of the stomach or intestines
of a goat, stuffed with blood and fat, and kept
revolving before a hot fire until thoroughly done.
The Suitors, of noble lineage though they were,
occasionally supped off this seductive viand, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>may, nevertheless, be concluded to have engaged
chiefly plebeian patronage.</p>

<p class='c015'>No quality of game is known to have been rejected
through prejudice or superstition by the Homeric
Greeks. But even venison ranked in the second line
after beef, mutton, and pork. It was sheer hunger
that made the ‘sequestered stag’ brought down by
Odysseus in Ææa a real godsend to his disconsolate
crew; and hunger again reduced them, in the island
of Thrinakie, to the necessity of supporting life with
fish and birds, both kinds of prey equally being taken
by means of baited hooks.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c017'><b>[245]</b></a> But they set about their
capture only when the exhaustion of the ship’s store
of flour and wine warned them to bestir themselves;
and the regimen their ingenuity provided was so distasteful,
and fell so little short, in their opinion and
sensations, of absolute starvation, that the fatal
temptation to seek criminal relief at the expense of
the oxen of the Sun, proved irresistible. They
succumbed to it, and perished.</p>

<p class='c015'>Small birds were, however, beyond doubt habitually
eaten by the poor. The snaring of pigeons and
fieldfares is alluded to in the Odyssey,<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c017'><b>[246]</b></a> and was
practised, we may be sure, in the interests of the
appetite. Nor can we suppose that Penelope and the
‘divine Helen’ entirely abstained from tasting the
geese reared by them, although curiosity and amusement
may have been the chief motives for the care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>bestowed upon them. Poultry of other kinds, as we
have seen in another chapter, there was none. But
hares must have been used for food, since, like roebucks
and wild goats, they were hunted with dogs,<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c017'><b>[247]</b></a>
certainly not for the mere sake of sport. As regards
boars, the case stands somewhat differently. For
their destructiveness imposed their slaughter as a
necessity. The subsequent consumption of their flesh
is left to conjecture. The remains of the Calydonian
brute seem to have been contended for rather
through arrogance than through appetite, Meleager
and the sons of Thestius standing forth as the champions
of antagonistic claims to the trophies of the
chace. That the boar sacrificed in attestation of the
oath of Agamemnon in the Nineteenth Iliad was afterwards
flung by Talthybius far into the sea to be ‘food
for fishes,’ is without significance on the point of edibility.
Victims thus immolated never furnished the
material for feasts; they belonged to the subterranean
powers, and fell under the shadow of their inauspicious
influence.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fish-eating tastes of the Greeks were of comparatively
late development. Homeric prepossessions
were decidedly against ‘fins and shining scales’
of every variety. Eels were ranked apart. Etymological
evidence shows them to have been primitively
classified with serpents,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c017'><b>[248]</b></a> and they appeared, from this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>point of view, not merely unacceptable, but absolutely
inadmissible, as food. The resemblance was thus protective,
not by the design of nature, but through the
misapprehension of man, and the ingenuity of hunger
was diverted from seeming watersnakes to less repulsive
prey. This was found in the silvery shoals and
‘fry innumerable’ inhabiting the same element, but
differentiated from their congeners by the more obvious
possession, and more active use of fins. The
Homeric fishermen, however, were not enthusiastic in
their vocation. Its meditative pleasures made no
appeal to them, and they were very sensible of the
unsatisfied gastronomic cravings which survived the
utmost success in its pursuit. Nets or hooks were
employed as occasion required. A heavy haul from
the deep is recalled by the gruesome spectacle of the
piled-up corpses in the banqueting-hall at Ithaca.</p>

<p class='c022'>But he found all the sort of them fallen in their blood in the
dust, like fishes that the fishermen have drawn forth in the
meshes of the net into a hollow of the beach from out the grey
sea, and all the fish, sore longing for the salt sea-waves, are
heaped upon the sand, and the sun shines forth and takes their
life away; so now the wooers lay heaped upon each other.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c017'><b>[249]</b></a></p>
<p class='c024'>We do not elsewhere hear of net-fishing;<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c017'><b>[250]</b></a> but rod-and-line
similes occur twice in the Iliad, and once in
the Odyssey. So Patroclus, after the manner of an
angler, hooked Thestor, son of Enops.</p>

<p class='c015'>Homeric seafarers did not resort to fishing as a
means of diversifying the monotony, either of their
occupations or of their commissariat. They got out
their hooks and lines when famine was at hand, and
never otherwise. Menelaus accordingly, recounting
the story of his detention at Pharos, vivified the impression
of his own distress, and the hunger of his
men, by the mention of the piscatorial pursuits they
were reduced to.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c017'><b>[255]</b></a> And Odysseus, in his narrative to
Alcinous, similarly emphasised a similar experience.
Fishermen by profession, it can hence be inferred,
belonged to the poorest and rudest of the community.
Among them were to be found divers for oysters.
Patroclus, mocking the fall of Cebriones, exclaims:</p>

<p class='c022'>Out on it, how nimble a man, how lightly he diveth! Yea,
if perchance he were on the teeming deep, this man would
satisfy many by seeking for oysters, leaping from the ship, even
if it were stormy weather; so lightly now he diveth from the
chariot into the plain. Verily among the Trojans too there be
diving men.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c017'><b>[256]</b></a></p>
<p class='c024'>The trade was then well known, and the molluscs

a familiar article of diet. Their provision for the

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Neither fish nor flesh was, in the Homeric world,
preserved by means of salt or otherwise as a resource
against future need. The distribution of superfluity
was not better understood in time than in space.
Meat, as we have seen, was killed and eaten on the
spot; and the husbanding of fish-supplies was still
less likely to be thought of. Salt was, however, regularly
used as a condiment; it was sprinkled over
roast meat,<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c017'><b>[258]</b></a> and a pinch of salt was a proverbial
expression for the indivisible atom, so to speak, of
charity.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c017'><b>[259]</b></a> Only the marine stores of the commodity
were drawn upon; those concealed by the earth remained
unexplored—a circumstance in itself marking
the great antiquity of the poems; and it was accordingly
regarded as characteristic of an inland people to
eat no salt with their food.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c017'><b>[260]</b></a> Its efficacy for ritual
purification was fully recognised; and the ceremonial
of sacrifice probably involved some use of it; but this

<p class='c015'>The farinaceous part of Homeric diet was furnished,
according to circumstances, either by barley-meal,
or by wheaten flour. The former was lauded
as the ‘marrow of men’; ship-stores consisted mainly
of it; and it was probably eaten boiled with water
into a kind of porridge, corresponding perhaps by its
prominence in Achæan rustic economy, to the <i>polenta</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>of the Lombard peasantry. Barley is called by Pliny
‘the most antique form of food,’ and its antiquity
lent it sacredness. Hence the preliminary sprinkling
with barley-groats, alike of the victim, and of the
altar upon which it was about to be sacrificed. So
essential to the validity of the offering was this part
of the ceremony, that the guilty comrades of Odysseus,
in default of barley, had recourse to shred oakleaves,
in their futile attempt at bribing the immortal
gods with a share of the spoil, to condone their transgression
against the solar herds.</p>

<p class='c015'>The favourite Homeric epithet for barley was
‘white,’ and the quality of whiteness is also conveyed
by the name, <i>alphiton</i>, of barley-meal.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c017'><b>[262]</b></a> But our word
‘wheat’ has the same meaning, while the Homeric
<i>puros</i> was a yellow grain.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c017'><b>[263]</b></a> Nor can there be much
doubt that it was a different variety, identical, presumably,
with the small, otherwise unknown kind
unearthed at Hissarlik. As the finest cereal then
extant, its repute nevertheless stood high; its taste
was called ‘honey-sweet’; its consumption was
plainly a privilege of the well-to-do classes. Our
poet is not likely to have ‘spoken by the card’ when
he included wheat among the spontaneous products
of the island of the Cyclops; yet the assertion of its
indigenous growth there was repeated by Diodorus
Siculus,<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c017'><b>[264]</b></a> who had better opportunities for knowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the truth, and had taken out no official licence for its
embellishment. Nevertheless there is much difficulty
in believing that wheat had its native home elsewhere
than in Mesopotamia and Western India.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bakers were as little known as butchers to
Homeric folk, whose bread-making was of the elementary
description practised by the pile-dwellers of
Robenhausen and Mooseedorf. The corn was first
ground in hand-mills<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c017'><b>[265]</b></a> worked by female slaves, of
whom fifty were thus exclusively employed in the
palace of Alcinous.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c017'><b>[266]</b></a> The loaves or cakes, for which
the material was thus laboriously provided, were
probably baked on stones, like those fragmentarily
preserved during millenniums beneath Swiss lacustrine
deposits of peat and mud.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c017'><b>[267]</b></a> Only wheaten flour was so
employed in Achæan households; but wheaten bread
was indispensable to every well-furnished table, and
was neatly served round in baskets placed at frequent
intervals. Barley-bread was the invention of a later
age; the word <i>maza</i>, by which it is signified, does not
occur in the Epics.</p>

<p class='c015'>They include, however, the mention of two additional
kinds of grain, varieties, it is supposed, of spelt.
And of these one, <i>olura</i>, is limited to the Iliad, the
other, <i>zeia</i>, belongs properly to the Odyssey, occurring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>in the Iliad only in the traditional phrase ‘zeia-giving
soil.’ The expression doubtless enshrined the memory
of spelt-eating days, as did, among the Romans, the
appropriation of this species of corn for the <i>mola</i> of
sacrifices.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c017'><b>[268]</b></a> But neither <i>zeia</i> nor <i>olura</i> served within
Homer’s experience for human food; both were left
to horses, whose fodder was moreover enriched by the
addition of ‘white barley’ and clover, nay, in exceptional
cases, of wheat and wine. With these restoring
dainties the steeds of Hector were pampered by
Andromache on their return from battle; while the
snowy team of Rhesus shared with the ‘Trojan’
horses of Æneas, the generous wheaten diet provided
for them in the opulent stables of their new master,
the intrepid king of Argos.</p>

<p class='c015'>One of the unaccountable Egyptian perversities
enumerated by Herodotus<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c017'><b>[269]</b></a> was that of rejecting
wheat and barley as bread-stuffs, and adopting spelt

either rice or millet, since spelt does not thrive in hot

<p class='c015'>Vegetables figured very scantily, if at all, at
Achæan feasts. One species only is expressly apportioned
for heroic consumption. Nestor and Machaon
were avowedly guilty of eating onions as a relish with
wine.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c017'><b>[275]</b></a> Some degree of refinement has indeed been
vindicated for their tastes on the plea that the Oriental
onion is of infinitely superior delicacy to our objectionable
bulb; but we scarcely wrong the Pylian sage
by admitting the likelihood of his preference for the
stronger flavour; nor can we raise high the gustatory
standard according to which wine compounded with
goats’ cheese and honey was esteemed the most refreshing
and delightful of drinks. The same root,
moreover, in its crudest form, seems to have recommended
itself to refined Phæacian palates. There is
persuasive, if indirect evidence, that ‘the rank and
guilty garlic’ was privileged to flourish in the sunny
gardens of Alcinous.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c017'><b>[276]</b></a> Socrates, indeed, eulogised the
onion, whereas Plutarch contemned it as vulgar, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Horace did not willingly permit onion-eaters to come
‘between the wind and his nobility.’ The company
of Nestor would not, then, have been agreeable to
him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Peas and beans keep out of sight in the Odyssey,
but are just glanced at in the Iliad. The following
simile explains itself:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As from the spreading fan leap out the peas</div>
      <div class='line'>Or swarthy beans o’er all the spacious floor,</div>
      <div class='line'>Urged by the whistling wind and winnower’s force;</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Here there is evidently no thought of green vegetables.
The elastic and agile pellets cleansed by
winnowing were fully ripe. They can be identified as
chick-peas and broad-beans—species, both of them,
abundantly produced in modern Greece. The former
even retain in Crete their Homeric name of <i>erebinthoi</i>,
ground down, however, by phonetic decay to <i>rebithi</i>.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c017'><b>[278]</b></a>
They afforded, under the designation ‘<i>frictum cicer</i>,’
a staple article of food to the poorer inhabitants of
Latium; and, as the Spanish <i>garbanzo</i>, they derive
culinary importance from the part assigned to them
in every properly constituted <i>olla podrida</i>.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c017'><b>[279]</b></a> Beans
were the first pod-fruit cultivated. They are mentioned
in the Bible, and have been excavated at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Hissarlik. Some pea-like grains, however, found in
the same spot, proved on examination to be lentils.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c017'><b>[280]</b></a>
These, too, were presumably in common use when
Homer lived, as they certainly were some centuries
later, yet he makes no allusion to them. More significant,
possibly, is his silence on the subject of chestnuts.
Although the tree covers wide tracts of modern
Greece, it is held by some eminent authorities to have
been introduced there from Pontic Asia Minor at a
comparatively late period.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c017'><b>[281]</b></a> And the fact that the
rural wisdom of Hesiod completely ignores the chestnut
certainly inclines the balance towards the opinion
of its arrival subsequent to the composition of the
‘Works and Days.’</p>

<p class='c015'>Grapes and olives are the only fruits of which the
cultivation is recorded in the Iliad; but the list is
greatly extended in the Odyssey. Alcinous had at
perennial command, besides apples and pears, figs and
pomegranates. Within the precincts of his palace,
Odysseus cast his exploratory glances round ‘a great
garden of four plough-gates,’ hedged round on either
side.</p>

<p class='c022'>‘And there grow tall trees blossoming, pear-trees and pomegranates,
and apple-trees with bright fruit, and sweet figs and
olives in their bloom. The fruit of these trees never perisheth
neither faileth, winter nor summer, enduring through all the
year. Evermore the west wind blowing brings some fruits to
birth and ripens others. Pear upon pear waxes old, and apple
on apple, yea, and cluster ripens upon cluster of the grape, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>fig upon fig. There too hath he a fruitful vineyard planted,
whereof the one part is being dried by the heat, a sunny spot
on level ground, while other grapes men are gathering, and yet
others they are treading in the wine-press. In the foremost
row are unripe grapes that cast the blossom, and others there
be that are growing black to vintaging. There, too, skirting the
furthest line, are all manner of garden beds, planted trimly,
and that are perpetually fresh, and therein are two fountains of
water.’<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c017'><b>[282]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The same fruits, the grape excepted, as being too
low-growing to fulfil the required conditions, hung
suspended above the head of Tantalus in his dusky
abode, where alone the olive seems to be classed as
food. They claimed, moreover, all but the pomegranate,
the care of Laertes, occupying his chagrined
leisure during the absence of his son from Ithaca.</p>

<p class='c015'>Apples and pears are alike indigenous in Greece,
and their discovery, dried and split longitudinally,
among the winter-stores of the Swiss and Italian
lake-dwellers, suggests that they may have been
similarly treated, with a similar end in view, by
Achæan housewives. The apple evidently excited
Homer’s particular admiration; he, in fact, made it
his representative fruit. That it should have been so
considered in the North, where competition for the
place of honour was small, is less surprising; and
apples, accordingly, of an etherealised and paradisaical
kind, served to restore youth to the aging gods of
Asaheim.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c017'><b>[283]</b></a></p>

‘apple’ of Paris. Known to the Greeks by the Semitic
name <i>roia</i>, it may hence be safely classed among
Phœnician gifts to the West. And its associations
were besides characteristically Oriental. The fruit,
called from the Sun-god Rimmon, had a prominent
place in Syrian religious rites; Aphrodite introduced
it into Cyprus, and eventually transferred to Demeter
her claims to the symbolical ownership of it.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c017'><b>[284]</b></a> But

<p class='c015'>The wild fig-tree is native in Greece, and is mentioned
both in the Iliad and Odyssey. But the cultured
fig occurs only in the latter poem, the author
doubtless having made its acquaintance somewhere
on the Anatolian seaboard, whither it would naturally
have been conveyed from Phrygia. For Phrygia was
in those days more renowned for its figs than Attica
became later. Those of Paros were celebrated by
Archilochus about 700 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>;<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c017'><b>[285]</b></a> but none, it would seem,
were produced on the mainland of Greece when
Hesiod’s homely experiences took metrical form at
Orchomenus. The ripe figs contributed by his garden
to the frugal repasts of Laertes were then an anachronism
to the full as glaring as turkeys in England,
when Falstaff and Poins took purses ‘as in a castle,
cock-sure,’ on Gadshill. The very idea, indeed, of
archæological accuracy was foreign to the mind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>either poet; nor could it, without detriment to the
vigour and freedom of their conceptions, have been
introduced.</p>

<p class='c015'>The pastoral section of the Achæan people drew
their subsistence immediately, and almost exclusively
from their flocks and herds. The commodities directly
at hand were supplemented to a very slight extent, if
at all, through the secondary channels of sale or
barter. Milk and cheese hence formed the staple of
their food, and were mainly the produce of sheep and
goats. Cow’s milk never found favour in Greece;
Homer ignored the possibility of its use; Aristotle
depreciated its quality; and it is now no more thought
of as an article of consumption than ewe’s milk in
Great Britain or Ireland.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c017'><b>[286]</b></a> Those early herdsmen
differed from us, too, in liking their simple beverage
well watered. The part played occasionally by the
pump in our London milk-supply would have met
with their full approbation—unless, indeed, they
might have preferred to add the qualifying ingredient
at their own discretion. But the native strength of
milk was, at any rate, too much for them. Only
Polyphemus, a giant and a glutton, was voracious
enough to swallow the undiluted contents of his pails.
To him, as to his curious visitors from over the sea,
butter-making was an unknown art, cheese being the
sole modified product of Homeric dairies. That the
first step towards its preparation consisted in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>curdling of fresh milk with the sap of the fig-tree, we
learn from the following allusion:</p>

<p class='c015'>Although the keeping of bees was strange to
Homer’s experience, the product of their industry was
pleasantly familiar to him. The ideal of deliciousness
was furnished by honey, and Homeric palates reached
their acme of gratification with things ‘honey-sweet.’
But Homeric bees were still in a state of nature, their
‘roofs of gold’ getting built in hollow trees or rocky
clefts. Artificial dwellings were provided for them,
by interested human agency, considerably later. The
use of bee-hives in Greece is first attested in the
Hesiodic Theogony; and in Russia and Lithuania,
wild honey was still gathered in the woods little more
than a century and a half ago.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c017'><b>[288]</b></a> Alike in the Iliad
and Odyssey, honey figures in a manner totally inconsistent
with our notions of gastronomic harmony.

palates indeed must have been hardy, and the constitutions
robust, of those upon whom it acted as an

<p class='c024'>Nothing loath, they obeyed, nor did they shrink
from adding piquancy to the liquid concoction by
simultaneously devouring a dozen or so of raw onions!
A precisely similar drink, designed as a vehicle for
the ‘evil drugs’ mingled with it, was treacherously

<p class='c015'>Honey is now, to a great extent, a superannuated
article of food. The sugar-cane has usurped its place
and its importance. But to the ancients, its value,
as the chief saccharine ingredient at their disposal,
was enormous. It could not then be expected that
the myth-making faculty should remain idle in regard
to it. The nectar of the earth was accordingly believed
to drop down from heaven into the calyxes of
half-opened flowers; it fell from the rising stars, or,
at any rate, near the places, so Aristotle averred,<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c017'><b>[293]</b></a>
whence they rose, and was distilled from rainbows upon
the blossoming plains they seemed to touch. Nature’s
winged agents, too, for the collection of what must
have seemed to the first rude experimenters in diet, an
almost supersensual dainty, had a niche assigned to
them in the edifice of fancy. Bees were connected
with poetry, music, and eloquence; as <i>Musarum volucres</i>,
they brought the gift of song to the sleeping
Pindar; they were themselves nymphs and priestesses,
intertwined more especially with the worship of Demeter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>and Cybele.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c017'><b>[294]</b></a> The germ of some of these imaginative
shoots and sprays seems to be laid bare in the
simple Homeric metaphor by which the discourse of
Nestor was said to flow with more than the sweetness
of honey from his lips.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c017'><b>[295]</b></a> The same idea—a very
obvious one—is embodied in the English word <i>mellifluous</i>.
But a figure, in older times, was often only
the beginning of a fable; and hence the hovering of
bees about the lips of the infant Plato, and round the
head of Krishna, when he expounded the nature of the
divinity. A genuine Homeric trace, moreover, of
the legendary associations of bees is supplied by their
installation in the Nymphs’ Grotto at Ithaca,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c017'><b>[296]</b></a> where
they gathered honey for the local divinities, ministering
to them as Melissa, the Nymph-bee <i>par excellence</i>,
ministered to the young Zeus on Ida.</p>

<p class='c015'>Homer was fully acquainted with the virtue of
honey for propitiating the dead. A vase of honey
was placed by Achilles on the pyre of Patroclus,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c017'><b>[297]</b></a> and
Odysseus poured a due libation of milk and honey as
part of his apparatus of enticement to the shade of
Tiresias. Subsequent experience showed this beverage
to be acceptable even to the Erinyes; nor was Cerberus
proof against a lure of honey-cakes. Luckily
for himself, however, Odysseus escaped an encounter
with the Dog of Hades, for whom he brought no
pacifying recipe.</p>

<p class='c015'>The earliest European intoxicant was made from
honey, but was in Greece quickly and completely discarded
on the introduction of vine-culture. Floating
reminiscences of its primitive use, however, were preserved
by Plutarch and Aristotle,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c017'><b>[298]</b></a> and survived unconsciously
in the tolerably frequent substitution, by
Homer, of the word ‘mead,’ under the form μέθυ, for
‘wine.’ The survival was indeed linguistic only. No
mental association with honey clung to the term
‘mead.’ The fermented juice of the grape is the sole
Homeric stimulant, and excites a fully corresponding
amount of Homeric enthusiasm. From the old epics,
accordingly, Pindaric praises of water are wholly
absent. The crystal spring occupies in them a strictly
subordinate place. The merits allowed to it are
purely relative. That is to say, it exercises, like the
nitrogen of our atmosphere, a qualifying function.
The exuberant energy of a more fiery element is
modified by its innocuous presence, and it helps to
neutralise some of the heady virtue inherent in the
‘subtle blood of the grape.’</p>

<p class='c015'>A draught of clear water was a luxury unappreciated
by the early Greeks. On the other hand, they
freely watered their wine, counting its full strength
scarcely less redoubtable than that of raw spirits
appears to ordinary Englishmen. Polyphemus alone
drank—in post-Homeric phraseology—’like a Scythian’—that
is, swallowed his liquor ‘neat’; and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>plunged thereby into disastrous drunkenness. The
wine provided for him, it is true, was of unusual and
overweening potency. Of Thracian growth, it was
supplied to Odysseus by Maron, a priest of Apollo at
Ismarus, in grateful acknowledgment of protection
afforded during the Odyssean sack of the Ciconian
metropolis. The secret of its manufacture was jealously
guarded in the Maronian family;<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c017'><b>[299]</b></a> its bouquet
was irresistible; its power against sobriety formidable.
Even if the statement that it required, or at least
tolerated, a twenty-fold admixture of water, be taxed
as hyperbolical, we can still fall back upon Pliny’s
assurance that the Maronian wine of his epoch was
commonly diluted with eight measures of water;<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c017'><b>[300]</b></a> and
the proportion of twenty-five to one of Thasian wine
from the same neighbourhood was recommended by
Hippocrates for invalids.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c017'><b>[301]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Red wines only were quaffed by Homeric heroes.
‘Golden,’ or ‘white’ kinds were unknown to them;
and it may be suspected that the pleasure of sharing
their potations would have been qualified, to modern
connoisseurs, by strong gustatory disapproval. We
do not know that the practice of using turpentine in
the preparation of wine prevailed so early, but it was
in full force when Plutarch wrote, and it subsisted too
long for the comfort of Mr. Dodwell, who warmly
protested his preference of sour English beer to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>resinous wines of Patra and Libadia.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c017'><b>[302]</b></a> Some of
their worst qualities were probably shared by the
famous ‘Pramnian,’ described by Galen as ‘black
and austere.’<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c017'><b>[303]</b></a> This was the leading component of
the draught administered by Hecamede and Circe;
but traditions as to its local origin are obscure and
contradictory. The credit of its production was now
assigned to a mountain in Caria, now to the Icarian
Isle, or to some favoured section of Lesbian territory.
Others again held that its distinction resided, not in
the place of its growth, but in the method of its
manufacture. A particular variety of grape perhaps
yielded it; at any rate, Dioscorides says that it was a
<i>prototropum</i>—that is, a product of the first running of
self-expressed juice, making it, among wines, what a
proof before letters is among engravings. It took
rank, however this might have been, as a choice
vintage, meet for the refreshment of heroes, and
strictly reserved for exceptional use; while the ordinary
demand of the army before Troy was met by the
importation of Lemnian and Thracian wines of commonplace
quality, brought in ships to the shores of the
Hellespont, and purchased with the spoils of war—copper
and iron, cattle and slaves.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c017'><b>[304]</b></a> A night’s carouse
might sometimes ensue upon the arrival of a wine-fleet;
but temperance was the rule of old Achæan
life. Excess was reprobated, and often figured as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>cause of misfortune. Thus, the ‘Drunken Assembly,’
held immediately after the sack of Troy, was the first
link in the long chain of disasters incurred by the
returning Achæans;<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c017'><b>[305]</b></a> Elpenor, one of the crew of
Odysseus, preceded him to Hades ‘on foot,’ as it is
quaintly said, having broken his neck by a fall from
a roof-top when overcome with wine in the house of
Circe; the ungovernable rage of Achilles could find
no more opprobrious epithet than ‘wine-laden’ to be
hurled, in lieu of a javelin, at Agamemnon; and in
Polyphemus, vinous excess assuredly took on its least
inviting aspect. The Homeric ideal of life was indeed
a festive one, but the conviviality it included was
kept within the bounds of moderation and decorum.
Moreover, the pleasures of the table, however keenly
appreciated, were redeemed from grossness by the
finer touches of social sympathy and æsthetic enjoyment.
Minstrelsy formed a regular part of a well
ordered entertainment, and the rhythmical movements
of the dance accompanied, on occasions, or alternated
with chanted narratives of adventure.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the palace of Ithaca, guests were served at
separate small tables; but this may not have been
the case everywhere. An erect posture was maintained
by them. The Roman fashion of reclining at meals
came in much later. An opening formality of ablution
was designed for ceremonial purification; in the interests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of corporeal cleanliness, a repetition of the
process after the meal was concluded would have been
desirable, but appears to have been neglected. As
regards the food-supply, a stewardess, or housekeeper,
brought round bread in a basket; a carver
sliced and distributed the grilled meat; a herald filled
the goblets in orderly succession; and good appetites
did the rest. Women habitually ate apart. So Penelope
sat by, spinning and silent, though feverish with
eagerness for news of her absent lord, until Telemachus
and Theoclymenus had concluded their repast; and
Nausicaa supped in retirement while her father feasted
with the Phæacian elders. But the rule of seclusion
appears to have had no application to nymphs and
goddesses. Wine, however, was freely allowed to
women and children. Arêtê, the mother of Nausicaa,
supplied a goat’s skin full for her pic-nic by the seashore;
and it was with wine that the tunic of Phœnix
was wont to be soiled as he fed the infant Achilles
upon his knee.</p>

<p class='c015'>Three meals a day made the full Homeric complement,
reduced, nevertheless, to two under frequently
recurring circumstances. Breakfast—<i>ariston</i>—was
not always insisted upon, and we hear only twice of
its formal preparation. It consisted ordinarily, there
is reason to believe, of nothing more than bread
soaked in wine; but Eumæus, who, for all his vigilant
husbandry, loved talk and good cheer, offered better
fare to his wily, unknown guest. A fire was lit in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>hut at dawn; some cold pork, left from supper the
night before, got re-broiled, and was barely hot when
Telemachus made an appearance more welcome than
looked for, having run the gauntlet of the Suitors’
sea-ambuscade on his return from Pylos. Hence a
considerable amount of weeping for joy was indispensable
before they could all three—seeming beggar,
prince, and swineherd—sit down comfortably to breakfast
together.</p>

<p class='c015'>But when life ran out of its accustomed groove,
and opportunities for eating became precarious, breakfast
and dinner—<i>ariston</i> and <i>deipnon</i>—were apt to
coalesce. Noon, the regular dinner-hour, might,
under such circumstances, be anticipated. Thus,
when Telemachus and Pisistratus were setting out
from Sparta towards Pylos, Menelaus, who was the
soul of hospitality, ordered a <i>deipnon</i> to be hastily
got ready, and it had certainly been preceded by no
lighter repast. The third Homeric meal—<i>dorpon</i>—was
taken at, or after sundown. Its status fluctuated.
Of primary importance to those busily engaged in
out-of-door occupations, it counted for relatively little
with idle folk like the Suitors, whose feasts and diversions
might be prolonged, if they so willed it, from
dawn to dusk. Supper, on the other hand, was naturally
the chief meal of soldiers and sailors. ‘Perils
will be paid with pleasures,’ says Verulam; and when
the rage of battle was spent, or the ship brought
safely into port, a banquet was spread with every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>available luxury, and enjoyed to the utmost. At sea,
cooking was reduced to a minimum, even to zero, the
probability being small that fires were ever kindled
on shipboard. So that the hardships of long voyages
were very great, if rarely incurred. When possible,
land was made by nightfall, the vessel moored, and
the crew disembarked.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>There</span> are certain low-lying districts in southern
Spain where the branched lily, or king’s spear, blooms
in such profusion that whole acres, seen from a distance
towards the end of March, show as if densely
strewn with new-fallen snow. Just such in aspect
must have been the abode of the Odyssean dead.
There, along boundless asphodel plains, Odysseus
watched Orion, a spectral huntsman pursuing spectral
game: there Agamemnon denounced the treachery of
Clytemnestra: there Ajax still nursed his wrath at
the award of the Argive kings: there Achilles gnawed
a shadowy heart in longing, on any terms, for action
and the upper air: thither Hermes conducted the
delinquent souls of the suitors of Penelope. A tranquil
dwelling-place: where the stagnant air of apathy
was stirred only by sighs of inane regret.</p>

<p class='c015'>Homer’s asphodel grows only in the under-world,
yet it is no mythical plant. It can be quite clearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>identified with the <i>Asphodelus ramosus</i>,<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c017'><b>[306]</b></a> now extensively
used in Algeria for the manufacture of alcohol,
and cultivated in our gardens for the sake of its tall
spikes of beautiful flowers, pure white within and
purple-streaked without along each of the six petals
uniting at the base to form a deeply-indented starry
corolla. The continual visits of pilfering bees attest
a goodly store of honey; while the perfume spread
over the northern shores of the Gulf of Corinth by
the abundant growth of asphodel was said to have
given their name, in some far-off century, to the
Ozolians of Locris.</p>

<p class='c015'>Introduced into England about 1551, it was succeeded,
after forty-five years, by the yellow asphodel
(<i>Asphodelus luteus</i>), of which already in 1633 Gerard
in his Herbal reports ‘great plenty in our London
gardens.’ Hence Pope’s familiarity with this kind,
and his consequent matter-of-course identification of
it with the classical flower in the lines,</p>

<p class='c024'>wherein he has entirely missed what may with some
reason be called the local colouring of Hades.</p>
<p class='c015'>In order to explain the lugubrious associations of
the branched asphodel, we must go back to an early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>stage of thought regarding the condition of the
dead.</p>

<p class='c015'>Instinctively man assumes that his existence will,
in some form, be continued beyond the grave. Only
a few of the most degraded savages, or a handful of
the most enlightened sceptics, accept death with stolid
indifference as an absolute end. The almost universally
prevalent belief is that it is a change, not a close.
Humanity, as a whole, never has admitted and never
can apostatise from its innate convictions by admitting
that its destiny is mere blank corruption. Apart
from the body, however, life can indeed be conceived,
but cannot be imagined; since imagination works
only with familiar materials. Recourse was then
inevitably had to the expedient of representing the
under-world as a shadowy reflection of the upper.
Disembodied spirits were supposed to feel the same
needs, to cherish the same desires, as when clothed
in the flesh; but they were helpless to supply the
first or to gratify the second. Their opulence or
misery in their new abode depended solely upon the
pitying care of those who survived them. This mode
of thinking explains the savage rites of sacrifice attendant
upon primitive funeral ceremonies: it converted
the tombs of ancient kings into the treasure-houses of
modern archæologists; and it suggested a system of
commissariat for the dead, traces of which still linger
in many parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c015'>Here we find the clue we are in search of. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>afforded by the simple precautions adopted by unsophisticated
people against famine in the realm of
death. Amongst the early Greeks, the roots of the
branched lily were a familiar article of diet. The
asphodel has even been called the potato of antiquity.
It indeed surpassed the potato in fecundity, though
falling far below it in nutritive qualities. Pliny, in
his ‘Natural History,’ states that about eighty tubers,
each the size of an average turnip, were often the
produce of a single plant; and the French botanist
Charles de l’Écluse, travelling across Portugal in
1564-5, saw the plough disclose fully two hundred
attached to the same stalk, and together weighing, he
estimated, some fifty pounds. Moreover, the tubers
so plentifully developed are extremely rich in starch
and sugar, so that the poorer sort, who possessed no
flocks or herds to supply their table with fat pork,
loins of young oxen, roasted goats’ tripe, or similar
carnal delicacies, were glad to fall back upon the
frugal fare of mallow and asphodel lauded by Hesiod.
Theophrastus tells us that the roasted stalk, as well
as the seed of the asphodel served for food; but
chiefly its roots, which, bruised up with figs, were in
extensive use. Pliny seems to prefer them cooked in
hot ashes, and eaten with salt and oil; but it may be
doubted whether he spoke from personal experience.</p>

<p class='c015'>Their consumption, however, was recommended
by the example of Pythagoras, and was said to have
helped to lengthen out the fabulous years of Epimenides.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Yet, such illustrious examples notwithstanding,
the degenerate stomachs of more recent times
have succeeded ill in accommodating themselves to
such spare sustenance. When about the middle of
last century the Abate Alberto Fortis was travelling
in Dalmatia, he found inhabitants of the village of
Bossiglina, near Traù, so poor as to be reduced to
make their bread of bruised asphodel roots, which
proving but an indifferent staff of life, digestive
troubles and general debility ensued. This is the
last recorded experiment of the kind. The needs of
the human economy are far better, more widely, and
almost as cheaply subserved by the tuber brought by
Raleigh from Virginia. The plant of Persephone is
left for Apulian sheep to graze upon.</p>

<p class='c015'>Asphodel roots, accordingly, rank with acorns as
a prehistoric, but now discarded article of human
food. They were, it is likely, freely consumed by the
earliest inhabitants of Greece, before the cultivation
of cereals had been introduced from the East. There
is little fear of error in assuming that the later
Achæan immigrants found them already consecrated
by traditional usage to the sustenance of the dead—perhaps
because the immemorial antiquity of their
dietary employment imparted to them an idea of
sacredness; or, possibly, because the slightness of
the nourishment they afforded was judged suitable to
the maintenance of the unsubstantial life of ghosts.
At any rate, the custom became firmly established of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>planting graves with asphodel, with a view to making
provision for their silent and helpless, yet still needy
inmates. With changed associations the custom still
exists in Greece, and, very remarkably, has been
found to prevail in Japan, where a species of asphodel
is stated to be cultivated in cemeteries, and placed,
blooming in pots, on grave-stones. We can scarcely
doubt that the same train of thought, here as in
Greece, originally prompted its selection for sepulchral
uses. Unquestionably some of the natives of
the Congo district plant manioc on the graves of their
dead, with no other than a provisioning design.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c017'><b>[307]</b></a> The
same may be said of the cultivation of certain fruit-trees
in the burying-grounds of the South Sea Islanders.
One of these is the <i>Cratæva religiosa</i>, bearing
an insipid but eatable fruit, and held sacred in Otaheite
under the name of ‘Purataruru.’ The <i>Terminalia
glabrosa</i> fills (or filled a century ago) an analogous
position in the Society Islands. It yields a nut
resembling an almond, doubtless regarded as acceptable
to phantasmal palates.</p>

<p class='c015'>We now see quite clearly why the Homeric shades
dwell in meadows of asphodel. These were, in the
fundamental conception, their harvest-fields. From
them, in some unexplained subsensual way, the attenuated
nutriment they might require must have
been derived. But this primitive idea does not seem
to have been explicitly present to the poet’s mind.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>It had already, before his time, we can infer, been to
a great extent lost sight of. It was enough for him
that the plant was popularly associated with the
dusky regions out of sight of the sun. He did not
stop to ask why, his business being to see, and to
sing of what he saw, not to reason. He accordingly
made his Hades to bloom for all time with the tall
white flowers of the king’s spear, and so perpetuated
a connexion he was not concerned to explain.</p>

<p class='c015'>Homer cannot be said to have attained to any
real conception of the immortality of the soul. The
shade which flitted to subterranean spaces when the
breath left the body, resembled an animal principle
of life rather than a true spiritual essence. Disinherited,
exiled from its proper abode, without function,
sense, or memory, it survived, a vaporous image,
a mere castaway residuum of what once had been a
man. Tiresias, the Theban soothsayer, alone, by
special privilege of Persephone, retained the use of
reason: the rest were vain appearances, escaping
annihilation by a scarcely perceptible distinction.
No wonder that life should have been darkened by
the prospect of such a destiny—or worse. For there
were, in the Homeric world to come, awful possibilities
of torment, though none—for the common herd—of
blessedness. Deep down in Tartarus, those who
had sinned against the gods—Sisyphus, Ixion, Tantalus—were
condemned to tremendous, because unending,
punishment; while the haunting sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>loss, which seems to have survived every other form
of consciousness, giving no rest, nor so much as
exemption from fear, pursued good and bad alike.
Nowhere does the utter need of mankind for the hope
brought by Christianity appear with such startling
clearness as in the verses of Homer, from the contrast
of the vivid pictures of life they present with
the appalling background of despair upon which they
are painted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Its relation to the unseen world naturally brought
to the asphodel a host of occult or imaginary qualities.
Of true medicinal properties it may be said to
be devoid, and it accordingly finds no place in the
modern pharmacopœia. Anciently, however, it was
known, from its manifold powers, as the ‘heroic’
herb. It was sovereign against witchcraft, and was
planted outside the gates of villas and farmhouses to
ward off malefic influences. It restored the wasted
strength of the consumptive: it was an antidote to
the venom of serpents and scorpions: it entered as
an ingredient into love-potions, and was invincible by
evil spirits: children round whose necks it was hung
cut their teeth without pain, and the terrors of the
night flew from its presence. Briefly, its faculties
were those of (in Zoroastrian phraseology) a ‘smiter
of fiends’; yet from it we moderns distil alcohol!
Of a truth it has gone over to the enemy.</p>

      <div class='line'>Sweet is moly, but his root is ill,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>wrote Spenser in one of his sonnets. But it may be
doubted whether he would have committed himself
to this sentiment had he realised that the gift of
Hermes was neither more nor less than a clove of
garlic.</p>
<p class='c015'>Odysseus approaching the house of Circe in search
of his companions (already, as he found out later,
transformed into swine), was met on the road by the
crafty son of Maia, and by him forewarned and forearmed
against the wiles of the enchantress. Skilled
in drugs as she was, a more potent herb than any
known to her had been procured by the messenger of
the gods. ‘Therewith,’ the hero continued in his
narrative to the Phæacian king, ‘the slayer of Argos
gave me the plant that he had plucked from the
ground, and he showed me the nature thereof. It
was black at the root, but the flower was like to milk.
The gods call it moly, but it is hard for mortal men
to dig; howbeit, with the gods all things are possible.’
It is thus evident that the Homeric moly is compounded
of two elements—a botanical, so to speak,
and a mythological. A substratum of fact has received
an embellishment of fable. Before the mind’s
eye of the poet, when he described the white flowers
and black root of the vegetable snatched from the
reluctant earth by Hermes, was a specific plant, which
he chose to associate, or which had already become
associated, with floating legendary lore, widely and
anciently diffused among our race. The identification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of that plant has often been attempted, and not
unsuccessfully.</p>

<p class='c015'>The earliest record of such an effort is contained in
Theophrastus’s ‘History of Plants.’ He there asserts
the moly of the Odyssey to have been a kind of garlic
(<i>Allium nigrum</i>, according to Sprengel), growing on
Mount Cyllene in Arcadia (the birthplace, be it
observed, of Hermes), and of supreme efficacy as an
antidote to poisons; but he, unlike Homer, adds that
there is no difficulty in plucking it. We shall see
presently that this difficulty was purely mythical.
The language of Theophrastus suggests that the
association of moly with the Arcadian garlic was
traditional in his time; and the tradition has been
perpetuated in the modern Greek name, <i>molyza</i>, of a
member of the same family.</p>

<p class='c015'>John Gerard in his Herbal, calls moly (of which
he enumerates several species) the ‘Sorcerer’s garlic,’
and describes as follows the Theophrastian, assumed
as identical with the epic, kind.</p>

<p class='c022'>Homer’s moly hath very thick leaves, broad toward the
bottom, sharp at the point, and hollowed like a trough or gutter,
in the bosom of which leaves near unto the bottom cometh
forth a certain round bulb or ball of a green colour; which
being ripe and set in the ground, groweth and becometh a fair
plant, such as is the mother. Among those leaves riseth up a
naked, smooth, thick stalk of two cubits high, as strong as is a
small walking-staff. At the top of the stalk standeth a bundle
of fair whitish flowers, dashed over with a wash of purple
colour, smelling like the flowers of onions. When they be ripe
there appeareth a black seed wrapt in a white skin or husk.</p>
<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The root is great and bulbous, covered with a blackish skin on
the outside, and white within, and of the bigness of a great
onion.</p>

<p class='c021'>So much for the question in its matter-of-fact
aspect. We may now look at it from its fabulous
side.</p>

<p class='c015'>And first, it is to be remembered that moly was
not a charm, but a counter-charm. Its powers were
defensive, and presupposed an attack. It was as a
shield against the thrust of a spear. Now if any clear
notion could be attained regarding the kind of weapon
of which it had efficacy thus to blunt the point, we
should be perceptibly nearer to its individualisation.
But we are only told that the magic draught of Circe,
the effects of which it had power to neutralise, contained
pernicious drugs. The poet either did not
know, or did not care to tell more.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is, however, a plant round which a crowd
of strange beliefs gathered from the earliest times.
This is the <i>Atropa mandragora</i>, or mandrake, probably
identical with the <i>Dudaim</i> of Scripture, and called by
classical writers <i>Circæa</i>, from its supposed potency in
philtres. The rude resemblance of its bifurcated
root to the lower half of the human frame started
its career as an object of credulity and an instrument
of imposture. It was held to be animated with
a life transcending the obscure vitality of ordinary
vegetable existence, and occult powers of the most
remarkable kind were attributed to it. The little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>images, formed of the mandrake root, consulted as
oracles in Germany under the name of <i>Alrunen</i>, and
imported with great commercial success into this
country during the reign of Henry VIII., were
credited with the power of multiplying money left
in their charge, and generally of bringing luck to
their possessors, especially when their original seat
had been at the foot of a gallows, and their first
vesture a fragment of a winding-sheet. But privilege,
as usual, was here also fraught with peril. The
operation of uprooting a mandrake was a critical one,
formidable consequences ensuing upon its clumsy or
negligent execution. These could only be averted
by a strict observance of forms prescribed by the
wisdom of a very high antiquity. According to Pliny,
three circles were to be drawn round the plant with a
sword, within which the digger stood, facing west.
This position had to be combined, as best it might,
with an approach from the windward side, upon his
formidable prey. Through the pages of Josephus the
device gained its earliest publicity, of employing a
dog to receive the death penalty, attendant, in his
belief, on eradication. It was widely adopted, and
by mediæval sagacity fortified with the additional prescriptions
that the canine victim should be black without
a white hair, that the deed should be done before
dawn on a Friday, and that the ears of the doer
should be carefully stuffed with cotton-wool. For, at
the instant of leaving its parent-earth, a fearful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>sound, which no mortal might hear and sanely survive,
issued from the uptorn root. This superstition
was familiar in English literature down to the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus Suffolk alleging the futility of bad language
in apology for the backwardness in its use with which
he has just been reproached by the ungentle queen of
Henry VI., exclaims,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake’s groan,</div>
      <div class='line'>I would invent as bitter-searching terms,</div>
      <div class='line'>As curst, as harsh, and horrible to hear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Deliver’d strongly through my fixed teeth,</div>
      <div class='line'>With full as many signs of deadly hate,</div>
      <div class='line'>As lean-fac’d Envy in her loathsome cave.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>And poor Juliet enumerates among the horrors of the
charnel-house,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Shrieks like mandrakes’ torn out of the earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>That living mortals hearing them, run mad.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The persuasion was, moreover, included amongst
the Vulgar Errors gravely combated by Sir Thomas
Browne.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mandragora, then, is the most ancient and the
most widely famous of all magic herbs; and the old
conjecture is at least a plausible one that from its
exclusive possession were derived the evil powers
employed to the detriment of her wind-borne guests
by the inhospitable daughter of Perse.</p>

<p class='c015'>Moly, on the other hand, must be sought for
amongst the herbaceous antidotes of fable. Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the best known of these is the plant repugnant to
the fine senses of Horace, and equally abominable to
the nostrils of Elizabethan gallants. The name of
garlic in Sanskrit signifies ‘slayer of monsters.’
Juvenal ridiculed the Egyptians for paying it reverence
as a divinity.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The Eddic valkyr, Sigurdrifa, sang of its unassailable
virtue. As a sure preservative from witchcraft it
was, by mediæval Teutons, infused in the drink of
cattle and horses, hung up in lonely shepherds’ huts,
and buried under thresholds. It was laid on beds
against nightmare: planted on cottage roofs to keep
off lightning: it cured the poisoned bites of reptiles: it
was eaten to avert the evil effects of digging hellebore;
while, in Cuba, immunity from jaundice was
secured by wearing, during thirteen days, a collar
consisting of thirteen cloves of garlic, and throwing it
away at a cross-road, without looking behind, at
midnight on the expiration of that term. The occult
properties of this savoury root originated, no doubt,
as M. Hehn conceives,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c017'><b>[308]</b></a> in its pungent taste and smell.
Substances strongly impressive to the senses are apt
to acquire the reputation of being distasteful to ‘spirits
of vile sort.’ Witness sulphur, employed from of old,
in ceremonial purification. But this may have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>owing to its association, through the ‘sulphurous’
smell of ozone, with the sacred thunder-bolt.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r308'>308</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Wanderings of Plants</i>, p. 158.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>All the magic faculties of garlic, it may be remarked,
are directed to beneficent purposes; whereas
those of the mandrake (regarded as an herb, not as
an idol) are purely maleficent. Later folk-lore, however,
has not brought them into direct competition.
Each is thought of as supreme in its own line. Only
in the Odyssey (on the supposition here adopted)
they were permitted to meet, with the result of signal
defeat for the powers of evil.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus we see that the identification of moly with
garlic is countenanced by whatever scraps of botanical
evidence are at hand, fortified by a constant local
tradition, no less than by the fantastic prescriptions
of superstitious popular observance. The difficulty
or peril of uprooting, which made the prophylactic
plant obtained by Hermes all but unattainable to
mortals, is a common feature in vegetable mythology.
It figures as the price to be paid for something rarely
precious, enhancing its value and at the same time
affixing a scarcely tolerable penalty to its possession.
It belonged, for instance, in varying degrees, to hellebore
and mistletoe, as well as to mandragora. With
the last it most likely originated, and from it was
transferred by Homer, in the exercise of his poetical
licence, to moly.</p>

<p class='c015'>From the adventure in the Ææan isle, as from so
many others, Odysseus came out unscathed. But it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>was not without high moral necessity that he passed
through them. The leading motive of his character
is, in fact, found in his multiform experience. He is
appointed to see and to suffer all that comes within
the scope of Greek humanity. No vicissitudes, no
perils are spared him. Protection from the extremity
of evil must and does content him. For his keen
curiosity falls in with the design of his celestial
patroness, in urging him to drink to the dregs the
costly draught of the knowledge of good and evil. Yet
it is to be noted that from the house of the enchantress
there is no exit save through the gates of hell.</p>

<p class='c015'>Within the spacious confines of the universe there
is perhaps but one race of beings whose implanted
instincts and whose visible destiny are irreconcilably
at war. Man is born to suffer; but suffering has
always for him the poignancy of surprise. The long
record of multiform tribulation which he calls his
history, has been moulded, throughout its many
vicissitudes, by a keen and ceaseless struggle for enjoyment.
Each man and woman born into the world
looks afresh round the horizon of life for pleasure,
and meets instead the ever fresh outrage of pain.
Our planet is peopled with souls disinherited of what
they still feel to be an inalienable heritage of happiness.
No wonder, then, that quack-medicines for the cure of
the ills of life should always have been popular. Of
such nostrums, the famous Homeric drug nepenthes
is an early example, and may serve for a type.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>We read in the Odyssey that Telemachus had no
sooner reached man’s estate than he set out from
Ithaca for Pylos and Lacedæmon, in order to seek
news of his father from Nestor and Menelaus, the
two most eminent survivors of the expedition against
Troy. But he learned only that Odysseus had vanished
from the known world. The disappointment was
severe, even to tears, notwithstanding that the banquet
was already spread in the radiant palace of the
Spartan king. The remaining guests, including the
illustrious host and hostess, caught the infection of
grief, and the pleasures of the table were over-clouded.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Such is the story which has formed the basis of
innumerable conjectures. The name of the drug
administered by Helen signifies the negation of
sorrow; and we learn that it grew in Egypt, and that
its administration was followed by markedly soothing
effects. Let us see whither these scanty indications
as to its nature will lead us.</p>

<p class='c015'>Many of the ancients believed nepenthes to have
been a kind of bugloss, the leaves of which, infused
in wine, were affirmed by Dioscorides, Galen, and
other authorities, to produce exhilarating effects. It
is certain that in Plutarch’s time the hilarity of
banquets was constantly sought to be increased by
this means. But this was done in avowed imitation
of Helen’s hospitable expedient. It was, in other
words, a revival, not a survival, and possesses for us,
consequently, none of the instructiveness of an unbroken
tradition.</p>

<p class='c015'>A new idea was struck out by the Roman traveller
Pietro della Valle, who visited Persia and Turkey
early in the seventeenth century. He suspected the
true nepenthean draught to have been coffee! From
Egypt, according to the antique narrative, it was
brought by Helen; and by way of Egypt the best
Mocha reached Constantinople, where it served to
recreate the spirits, and pass the heavy hours, of the
subjects of Achmet. Of this hypothesis we may say,
in the phrase of Sir Thomas Browne, that it is ‘false
below confute.’ The next, that of honest Petrus la
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Seine, has even less to recommend it. His erudite
conclusion was that in nepenthes the long-sought
<i>aurum potabile</i>, the illusory ornament of the Paracelsian
pharmacopœia, made its first historical appearance!
Egypt, he argued, was the birthplace of
chemistry, and the great chemical desideratum from
the earliest times had been the production of a drinkable
solution of the most perfect among metals. Nay,
its supreme worth had lent its true motive to the
famous Argonautic expedition, which had been fitted
out for the purpose of securing, not a golden fleece in
the literal sense, but a parchment upon which the
invaluable recipe was inscribed. The virtues of the
elixir were regarded by the learned dissertator as
superior to proof or discussion, in which exalted position
we willingly leave them.</p>

<p class='c015'>More enthusiastic than critical, Madame Dacier
looked at the subject from a point of view taken up,
many centuries earlier, by Plutarch. Nepenthes,
according to both these authorities, had no real existence.
The effects ascribed to it were merely a figurative
way of expressing the charms of Helen’s conversation.</p>

<p class='c015'>But this was to endow the poet with a subtlety
which he was very far from possessing. Simple and
direct in thought, he invariably took the shortest way
open to him in expression; and circuitous routes of
interpretation will invariably lead astray from his
meaning. It is clear accordingly that a real drug, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Egyptian origin, was supposed to have soothed and
restored appetite to the guests of Menelaus—a drug
quite possibly known to Homer only by the rumour of
its qualities, which he ingeniously turned to account
for the purposes of his story. Now, since those qualities
were undoubtedly narcotic, the field of our choice
is a narrow one. We have only to inquire whether
any, and, if so, what, preparations of the kind
were anciently in use by the inhabitants of the Nile valley.</p>

<p class='c015'>Unfortunately our information does not go very
far back. A certain professor of botany from Padua,
however, named Prosper Alpinus, has left a remarkable
account of his personal observations on the point
towards the close of the sixteenth century. The
vulgar pleasures of intoxication appear to have been
(as was fitting in a Mohammedan country) little in
request: among all classes their place was taken by
the raptures of solacing dreams and delightful visions
artificially produced. The means employed for the
purpose were threefold. There was first an electuary
of unknown composition imported from India called
<i>bernavi</i>. But this may at once be put aside, since
the ‘medicine for a mind diseased’ given by Polydamna
to Helen was, as we have seen, derived from
a home-grown Egyptian herb. There remain of the
three soothing drugs mentioned by Alpinus, hemp
and opium. Each was extensively consumed; and
the practice of employing each as a road to pleasurable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>sensations was already, in 1580, of immemorial
antiquity. One of them was almost certainly the
true Homeric nepenthes. We have only to decide
which.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first, as being the cheaper form of indulgence,
was mainly resorted to, our Paduan informant tells
us, amongst the lower classes. From the leaves of
the herb <i>Cannabis sativa</i> was prepared a powder
known as <i>assis</i>, made up into boluses and swallowed,
with the result of inducing a lethargic state of dreamy
beatitude. <i>Assis</i> was fundamentally the same with
the Indian <i>bhang</i>, the Arabic <i>hashish</i>—one of the
mainstays of Oriental sensual pleasure.</p>

<p class='c015'>The earliest mention of hemp is by Herodotus.
He states that it grew in the country of the Scythians,
that from its fibres garments scarcely distinguishable
in texture from linen were woven in Thrace, and that
the fumes from its burning seeds furnished the nomad
inhabitants of what is now Southern Russia, with
vapour-baths, serving them as a substitute for
washing. Marked intoxicating effects attended this
peculiar mode of ablution.</p>

<p class='c015'>In China, from the beginning of the third century
of our era, if not earlier, a preparation of hemp
was used (it was said, with perfect success) as an
anæsthetic; and it is mentioned as a remedy
under the name of <i>b’hanga</i>, in Hindu medical works
of probably still earlier date. Its identity with
nepenthes was first suggested in 1839, and has since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>been generally acquiesced in. But there are two
objections.</p>

<p class='c015'>The practice of eating or smoking hemp, for the
sake of its exalting effects upon consciousness, appears
to have originated on the slopes of the Himalayas, to
have spread thence to Persia, and to have been transmitted
farther west by Arab agency. It was not,
then, primitively an Egyptian custom, and was assuredly
unknown to the wife of Thôn. Moreover, hemp
is not indigenous on the banks of the Nile. It came
thither as an immigrant, most probably long after
the building of the latest pyramid. Herodotus includes
no mention of it in his curious and particular
account of the country; and, which is still more
significant, no relic of its textile use survives. Not
a hempen fibre has ever been found in any of the
innumerable mummy-cases examined by learned Europeans.
The ancient Egyptians, it may then be concluded,
were unacquainted with this plant, and we
must look elsewhere for the chief ingredient of the
comfort-bringing draught distributed by the daughter
of Zeus.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is only opium left. It is legitimately
reached by the ‘method of exclusions.’ Should it
fail, no substitute can be provided. But it does not
fail. No serious discrepancy starts up to shake our
belief that in recognising opium under the disguise of
nepenthes we have indeed struck the truth. All the
circumstances correspond to admiration: the identification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>runs ‘on all fours.’ The physical effects indicated
agree perfectly with those resulting from a
sparing use of opium. They tend to just so much
elevation of spirits as would impart a roseate tinge to
the landscape of life. The intellect remains unclouded
and serene. The Nemesis of indulgence, however
moderate, is still behind the scenes. The exhibition
of a soporific effect has even been seriously thought
to have been designed by the poet in the proposal of
Telemachus to retire to rest shortly after the nepenthean
cup has gone round; but so bald a piece of
realism can scarcely have entered into the contemplation
of an artist of such consummate skill.</p>

<p class='c015'>For ages past, Thebes in Egypt has witnessed the
production of opium from the expressed juice of
poppyheads. Six centuries ago, the substance was
known in Western Europe as <i>Opium Thebaïcum</i>, or
the ‘Theban tincture.’ Prosper Alpinus states that
the whole of Egypt was supplied, at the epoch of his
visit, from Sajeth, on the site of the ancient hundred-gated
city. And since a large proportion of the upper
classes were undisguised opium-eaters, the demand
must have been considerable. Now it was precisely
in Thebes that Helen, according to Diodorus, received
the sorrow-soothing drug from her Egyptian hostess;
while the women of Thebes, and they only, still in
his time preserved the secret of its qualities and
preparation. Can we doubt that the ancient nepenthes
was in truth no other than the mediæval Theban
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>tincture? Even stripping from the statement of
Diodorus all historical value, its legendary significance
remains. It proves, beyond question, the existence
of a tradition localising the gift of Polydamna
in a spot noted, from the date of the earliest authentic
information on the subject, for the production of a
modern equivalent. The inference seems irresistible
that the two were one, and that, as De Quincey said,
Homer is rightly reputed to have known the virtues
of opium.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> undivided Aryans knew very little of the underground
riches of the earth. They transmitted to
their dispersed descendants no common words for
mining, forging, or smelting, none to indicate a metal
in general, and only one designative of a metal in
particular. This took in Sanskrit the form <i>ayas</i>, in
Latin, <i>æs</i>; it is represented by the German <i>Erz</i>,
equivalent to the English <i>ore</i>; and, after drifting
through a Celtic channel, took a new meaning and
form as <i>Eisen</i>, or <i>iron</i>.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c017'><b>[310]</b></a> The original signification
of the term was <i>copper</i>; and copper seems, in general,
to have been the first metal to engage the attention
of primitive man. This is easily accounted for.
Copper is widely distributed; it frequently occurs in
the native state, when its strong colour at once
catches the eye; it is easily worked, and displays a
luminous glow highly engaging to an unsophisticated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>taste for ornament. And, because copper was at
first the only substance of the kind known, its name
was used to determine those of other related substances.
Thus, in Sanskrit, iron was called ‘dark
blue <i>ayas</i>,’ <i>ayas</i> having come to mean metal in
general; and a specific sign (possibly that for <i>hardness</i>)
added, in the Egyptian inscriptions, to the
hieroglyph for copper, causes it to denote iron.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c017'><b>[311]</b></a> But
in South Africa these positions are exchanged. There
iron ranks as the fundamental metal; gold being
known to at least one Kafir tribe as ‘yellow,’ silver as
‘white,’ copper as ‘red’ iron.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c017'><b>[312]</b></a> And to these linguistic
facts corresponds the exceptional circumstance,
due probably to early intercourse with Egypt, that
the stone-age in South Africa yielded immediately to
an iron-age.</p>

<p class='c015'>In Asia, gold was discovered next after copper,
the Massagetæ, described by Herodotus, exemplifying
this stage of progress; silver, or ‘white gold’ succeeded,
bringing lead in its train; then, little by little,
tin crept into use; while iron, destined to predominate,
came last. All the six, however, are enumerated
in a Khorsabad inscription;<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c017'><b>[313]</b></a> they were familiar
to the ancient Egyptians, to the Israelites of the
Exodus, and to the Homeric Greeks.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Gold was with Homer supreme among terrestrial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>substances. It represented to him beauty, splendour,
power, wealth, incorruption. It was the metal of
the gods, and mortals by its profuse employment,
borrowed something of divine glory. Its availability
for them had, nevertheless, narrow limitations unfelt
supernally. For the visionary metal of Olympus
might be dispensed at will without restrictions either
as to quantity or qualities. Inexhaustible stores of it
lay at command; and it could be rendered infrangible
and impenetrable by some mythical process unknown
to sublunary metallurgists. Hence the golden
hobbles with which Poseidon secured his coursers
might have proved less satisfactory for the restraint
of commonplace Thracian or Thessalian horses; the
golden sword of Apollo would surely have bent in the
hand of Hector; the golden mansion of the sea-god
built for aye in the blue depths of the Ægean, could
not have supported its own weight for an hour on
realistic dry land; nor would the process of lifting
earth to heaven by hauling on a rope have been
facilitated by making that rope (as Zeus proposed to
do for the purpose in question) of gold. Of gold,
too, were the garments of the gods, their thrones,
utensils, implements, appurtenances; the pavement
of their courts was ‘trodden gold’; golden were the
wings of Iris, golden was the beauty of Aphrodite.
No doubt, all these attributions were half consciously
metaphorical, but their main design was to set off
immortal existence by decorating it with an enhanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>degree of the same kind of magnificence
marking the dignity of mortal potentates.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is remarkable that the Olympian gold in the
Shield of Achilles retained some part of the occult
virtue properly belonging to it only in that elevated
sphere. Of the five metallic layers composing the
great buckler, the middle and most precious one gets
the whole credit of having arrested the quivering
spears of Æneas and Asteropæus.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c017'><b>[314]</b></a> The verses, to be
sure, recording its superior efficacy are held to be
spurious, and the inclusion of a hidden stratum of
gold does indeed seem without reason, as it is certainly
without precedent. Yet the original poet would
not have altogether disavowed the inspiring idea of
the passage; and the alleged impenetrability of the
gold-mail of Masistius<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c017'><b>[315]</b></a> may be held to imply that
traces of its old mystical faculty of resistance lingered
about the metal so late as when Xerxes invaded
Greece.</p>

<p class='c015'>The metallic treasures allotted to the gods in the
Iliad are confiscated for human enrichment in the
Odyssey. For the golden automata of Hephæstus
are substituted the golden watch-dogs and torch-bearers
of Alcinous; resplendent dwellings are erected,
no longer on Olympus or at Ægæ, but in Sparta and
Phæacia; Helen shares with Artemis in the Odyssey
the golden distaff exclusively attributed to the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>in the Iliad; the ‘dreams of avarice,’ in short, are
tangibly realised, in the Epic of adventure, only by
human possessions; they shrink for the most part
into shadowy epithets where divine surroundings are
concerned. Nor is this diversity accidental or unmeaning.
It indicates a genuine shifting of the
mythological point of view—an advance, slight yet
significant, towards a more spiritualised conception
of deity.</p>

<p class='c015'>Oriental contact first stirred the <i>auri sacra fames</i>
in the Greek mind. That this was so the Greek
language itself tells plainly. For <i>chrusos</i>, gold, is a
Semitic loanword, closely related to the Hebrew
<i>chârûz</i>, but taken immediately, there can be no
reasonable doubt, from the Phœnician. The restless
treasure-seekers from Tyre were, indeed, as the
Græco-Semitic term <i>metal</i> intimates,<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c017'><b>[316]</b></a> the original
subterranean explorers of the Balkan peninsula. As
early, probably, as the fifteenth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> they
‘digged out ribs of gold’ on the islands of Thasos
and Siphnos, and on the Thracian mainland at
Mount Pangæum; and the fables of the Golden
Fleece, and of Arimaspian wars with gold-guarding
griffins, prove the hold won by the ‘precious bane’
over the popular imagination. Asia Minor was, however,
the chief source of prehistoric supply, the
native mines lying long neglected after the Phœnicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>had been driven from the scene. Midas was a typical
king in a land where the mountains were gold-granulated,
and the rivers ran over sands of gold. And it
was in fact from Phrygia that Pelops was traditionally
reported to have brought the treasures which made
Mycenæ the golden city of the Achæan world.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The Epic affluence in gold was not wholly fictitious.
From the sepulchres of Mycenæ alone about
one hundred pounds Troy weight of the metal have
been disinterred; freely at command even in the
lowest stratum of the successive habitations at Hissarlik,
it was lavishly stored, and highly wrought in
the picturesquely-named ‘treasure of Priam;’ and
has been found, in plates and pearls, beneath twenty
metres of volcanic debris, in the Cycladic islands
Thera and Therapia.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c017'><b>[317]</b></a> This plentifulness contrasts
strangely with the extreme scarcity of gold in historic
Greece. It persisted, however, mainly owing to the
vicinity of the auriferous Ural Mountains, in the
Milesian colony of Panticapæum, near Kertch, where
graves have been opened containing corpses shining
‘like images’ in a complete clothing of gold-leaf, and
equipped with ample supplies of golden vessels and
ornaments.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f317'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r317'>317</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Much, <i>Die Kupferzeit</i>, p. 41.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Silver<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c017'><b>[318]</b></a> was, at the outset, a still rarer substance
than gold. Not that there is really less of it. The
ocean alone is estimated to contain nearly ten thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>million tons, and the mines yielding it, though
few, are rich. But it occurs less obviously, and is
less easy to obtain pure. Accordingly, in some very
early Egyptian inscriptions, silver, by heading the
list of metals, claims a supremacy over them which
proved short-lived. It terminated for ever with the
scarcity that had produced it, when the Phœnicians
began to pour the flood of Spanish silver into the
markets and treasure-chambers of the East. Armenia
constituted another tolerably copious source of supply;
and it was in this quarter that Homer located the
‘birthplace of silver.’<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c017'><b>[319]</b></a> Alybé, on the coast of the
Euxine east of Paphlagonia, whence the Halizonians
came to Troy, was identified by Strabo with Chalybe,
a famous mining district.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c017'><b>[320]</b></a> The people there, indeed,
as Xenophon recorded, lived mostly by digging iron;
and their name was preserved in the Greek <i>chalups</i>,
steel, and survives with ourselves in <i>chalybeate</i> waters.
The district has, however, in modern times, again
become known as argentiferous. The Homeric tradition
receives countenance from the discovery, in the
neighbourhood of Tripoli, of antique, half obliterated
silver-workings; and from the existence, not far off,
of a ‘Silver-town’ (Gunnish-kana), and a ‘Silver-mountain’
(Gunnish-dagh), whence a large tribute in
silver still flowed, a few years ago, into the leaky
coffers of Turkey.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c017'><b>[321]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>The word <i>silver</i> (Gothic, <i>silubr</i>) has even been
conjecturally associated with the Homeric Alybé;<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c017'><b>[322]</b></a>
while other philologists prefer to regard it as equivalent
to the Assyrian <i>sarpu</i>.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c017'><b>[323]</b></a> All that is certain is
the absence of a general Aryan name for the metal,
showing that the Aryans collectively made no acquaintance
with it. Thus, the Greek <i>arguros</i> and the Latin
<i>argentum</i>, although closely related, are really different
words. That is to say, they were formed independently
from the common root, <i>ark</i>, to shine, modified
into <i>arg</i>, white. Its whiteness, in fact, has supplied
the designations of this metal in all parts of the world.
Silver is the ‘white iron’ of the Kaffirs, the ‘white
gold’ of the Afghans, the ‘white copper’ of the Vedic
Indians; and the antique Accadians and Egyptians
defined it by the same obvious quality.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c017'><b>[324]</b></a> The Greek
<i>arguros</i> is, then, a comparatively late word, formed,
perhaps, after the Achæan tribes were already settled
in their Hellenic home, when their first supplies of
silver began to come in from Pontic Asia Minor.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The subsequence of its invention to the adoption
into the Greek language of <i>chrusos</i>, gold, can be inferred
from the relative paucity of proper and placenames
compounded with it. Homer has only four
such, while his ‘golden’ appellations number thirteen.
Take as specimens the series Chryse, Chryses, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Chryseïs, designating a place in the Troad, the priest
of Apollo in that place, and his daughter, all memorably
connected with the tragic Wrath of Achilles.
The nomenclature, no doubt, took its rise from solar
associations; yet the typical relationship between gold
and the sun, silver and the moon, is nowhere in the
Epics directly recognised. Helios is never decorated
with the epithet ‘golden’; Apollo, if he wears a
golden sword, is more strongly characterised by his
silver bow. Lunar mythology is ignored; nor is the
ready metaphor of the ‘silver moon’ to be found in
Homeric verse. The ‘apparent queen’ of the nocturnal
sky does not there, as elsewhere in poetry and
folk-lore, ‘throw her silver mantle o’er the dark.’
The metallic sheen, on the other hand, of water
rippling in sunshine, produces its due effect in the
generation of epithets; rivers being habitually called
‘silver-eddying,’ and Thetis, the Undine of the Iliad,
wearing a specific badge as ‘silver-footed.’</p>

<p class='c015'>For the concrete purposes of actual decoration,
the metal was in constant Homeric demand. Heré’s
chariot and the car of Rhesus shone with its delicate
radiance; the chair of Penelope was spirally inwrought
with silver and ivory; the greaves of Paris were silver
clasped, and the sheath of his sword silver-studded;
a silver hilt adorned the weapon of Achilles, and the
strings of his lyre were attached to a silver yoke.<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c017'><b>[325]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Of silver, too, was the tool-chest of Hephæstus;
the guests of Circe ate off silver tables; the guests
of Menelaus, if particularly favoured, might have
bathed in silver tubs, two of which were presented
to him in Egypt; and from golden ewers water was
poured into silver basins for the ablutions before
meals in every establishment of some pretension.
The fittings shared the splendours of the furniture in
Odyssean palaces. In the great hall of Alcinous, the
door-posts and lintel were of silver, and golden and
silver hounds, fashioned by Hephæstus, kept watch
beside its golden gates. And the courts of Menelaus
were resplendent with gold, bronze, silver, and
electrum.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The term ‘electrum,’ however, is a somewhat
ambiguous one. In classical Greek, it denotes two
perfectly distinct substances, one metallic, the other
of organic origin—the latter, indeed, chiefly; the
word came to be applied almost exclusively to <i>amber</i>.
Or it may be that two primarily distinct words
coalesced with time into one. Lepsius has urged
the probability that the name of the metal was
of the masculine form <i>elektros</i>, while amber was designated
by the neuter <i>elektron</i>.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c017'><b>[326]</b></a> Nor is it unlikely that
these words had separate genealogies, the first being
derived from an Aryan root signifying ‘to shine,’ the
second from a Semitic name for resin. Phœnician
inscriptions may eventually throw light upon a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>point which must otherwise remain unsettled, by
acquainting us with the Phœnician mode of designating
amber.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The metallic electrum was an alloy of gold with
about twenty per cent. of silver. It occurs naturally,
but was produced artificially as well, especially in
Egypt, where <i>asem</i>, as it was called, came into favour
long before any of the pyramids were built. It was
in the Nile valley thought fit for goddesses’ wear, its
pale radiance suggesting feminine refinement; and
stores of it were laid up in the treasures of all the
early kings. The first Lydian coinage was of electrum;
many of the utensils and ornaments discovered
at Hissarlik and Mycenæ prove to be similarly composed;
and electrum continued in favour down to a
particularly late date in the Græco-Scythic settlements
on the Black Sea. It made one of its few
historical appearances in the ‘white gold’ offered by
Crœsus at Delphi;<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c017'><b>[327]</b></a> and there are two instances of its
epical employment. The ground of the Hesiodic
Shield of Hercules was inlaid, the walls of the
banqueting-hall of Menelaus were overlaid, with gold,
electrum, and ivory. Although, in two other passages
of the Odyssey, the same word undoubtedly designates
amber, it is safe to affirm that here, where mural incrustations
are in question, a metallic substance, none
other than the immemorial <i>asem</i> of Egypt, should be
understood. Egyptian analogies, as Lepsius many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>years ago pointed out, strongly support this supposition,
above all where Egyptian associations are so
marked as in the Odyssean description of the Spartan
court. Electrum is unknown in the Iliad. The word
occurs only in the form <i>elektor</i>, signifying ‘the beaming
sun.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The third Homeric metal, and the most important
of all, is <i>chalkos</i>. But what does <i>chalkos</i> mean?
Copper or bronze? The question is not one to be
answered off-hand or categorically. It has been long
and learnedly debated; and admits, perhaps, of no
decision more absolute than the cautious arbitrament
of Sir Roger de Coverley.</p>

<p class='c015'>No help towards clearing up the point in dispute
has been derived from etymological inquiries. The
word <i>chalkos</i> is without Aryan equivalents, and can
best be explained by means of the Semitic <i>hhalaq</i>,
signifying ‘metal worked with a hammer.’<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c017'><b>[328]</b></a> Its
primitive meaning, thus left conjectural, was most
probably ‘copper.’ For, from all parts of Europe,
evidence has gradually accumulated that the transition
from the use of stone to the use of bronze was
through a ‘copper age,’ which, though perhaps of
short duration, has left relics impossible to be
ignored. Indications are even forthcoming among
the prehistoric ‘finds’ at Hissarlik, of the tentative
processes by which copper was improved into bronze.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c017'><b>[329]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>The lower strata of ruins on the site of ancient Troy
contained articles and implements of approximately
pure copper; nearer the surface, a sensible ingredient
of tin was added, augmented, here and there, to the
normal proportion for bronze of about twelve per
cent. At Mycenæ, domestic vessels were fabricated
of copper, weapons and ornamental objects of bronze;
and a copper saw, dug from beneath the lavas of
Santorin, gives corroborative evidence of the early
Greek use of the unalloyed metal.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'><i>Chalkos</i>, then, must, to begin with, have denoted
copper, and indeed it partially preserves that sense in
the Homeric poems. The cargo, for example, taken
on board at Temesé, in Cyprus, by the Taphian king
Mentes,<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c017'><b>[330]</b></a> must have been of pure copper, the distinctively
‘Cyprian’ metal. The port of Temesé, afterwards
Tamassos, be it observed, was a Phœnician
establishment, and bore a Phœnician name denoting
‘smelting-house,’ both instructive circumstances as
regards the agency by which metallic supplies were
transmitted westward.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c017'><b>[331]</b></a> Again, when Achilles enumerated
with gold and ‘grey iron,’ red <i>chalkos</i> as forming
part of his wealth,<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c017'><b>[332]</b></a> he could have meant nothing but
unadulterated copper. The colour-adjective does not
recur, but its employment this once strongly supports
the inference that the unwrought <i>chalkos</i>, frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>spoken of as stored for future use or barter, was
without sensible admixture of tin.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>This inference, however, cannot reasonably be
carried further. Homeric armour was altogether of
<i>chalkos</i>, and it would be absurd to suppose that the
‘well-greaved Greeks’ went into action copper-clad.
This on two grounds. In the first place, archæological
research has proved to demonstration that
bronze was fully and freely available in the late Mycenæan
age, when Homer, there is good reason to believe,
flourished. Articles composed of it must have been
continually before his eyes and within his grasp.
Unless he deliberately elected, which is inconceivable,
to exclude from his poems all mention of a material
of primary importance to the known arts, his <i>chalkos</i>
was a term sufficiently comprehensive to embrace
<i>both</i> bronze and copper. In the second place, pure
copper could not have played the part assigned to it.
Its inadequacy as a material for weapons or armour
should promptly have led to its rejection. Assuredly
it could neither have sustained, nor been the means
of inflicting, the heavy blows and buffets exchanged
by the heroes of the Trojan War. The mere fact of
the shattering of Menelaus’s sword against the helmet
of Paris<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c017'><b>[333]</b></a> is conclusive as to its having been made of
a less yielding substance than copper;<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c017'><b>[334]</b></a> and the hardening

<p class='c015'>Moreover, it is incredible that the Homeric Greeks,
although acquainted with iron, had no share in the
bronze-culture flourishing, then and previously, along
the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. The persistence,
anywhere in that region, of so late, and so
extraordinarily developed a copper age, would indeed
be a glaring anomaly. Already,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c017'><b>[336]</b></a> in the third millennium
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, bronze tools were used in Egypt; and
under the name <i>zabar</i>, whence the Arabic <i>zifr</i>, bronze
was fabricated by Sumero-Accadian metallurgists at
the very outset of Mesopotamian civilisation.<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c017'><b>[337]</b></a> It was,
in fact, probably from Mesopotamia that knowledge
of the art and its attendant advantages was carried
westward by Sidonian traffickers. Customers, then,
who, like the Achæans, procured from them plentiful
supplies of copper, and a smaller quantity of tin, could
not long have remained ignorant of the vast superiority
of their alloyed over their separate condition.
The conclusion is inevitable that <i>chalkos</i>, like the
corresponding Hebrew term <i>nechosheth</i>, and the Egyptian
<i>chomt</i>, was a word of some elasticity of meaning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>designating ordinarily bronze, but occasionally copper.
The translation, it need hardly be said, of any of the
three by the English <i>brass</i> involves a gross error.
Copper was not systematically alloyed with zinc until
about the second century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c017'><b>[338]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>But the bronze industry of old must have been
seriously hampered in its growth and spread by the
scarcity of tin. This metal is of most restricted distribution.
The reservoirs of it held by the earth are
few and far apart. The two principal, in Cornwall
and the Malaccan peninsula respectively, are ‘wide as
the poles asunder.’ Yet its discovery goes back to a
hoar antiquity, and its prehistoric use was extensive
and continuous. This wide dispersion of so scarce
an article gives cogent proof of unexpectedly early
intercourse between remote populations, and strikingly
illustrates the effectiveness of those gradual processes
of primitive trade by which desirable commodities
permeated continents, and reached the least accessible
markets.</p>

<p class='c015'>The earliest historical source of tin was in the
Cassiterides, or ‘tin-islands’ of Britain; and there
can be no doubt, geographical mystifications notwithstanding,
that the tin thence derived came, directly
or indirectly, from Cornwall. Not improbably, the
staple of the Phœnician tin-trade was in the Isle of
Wight, which accordingly became the representative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>tin-island.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c017'><b>[339]</b></a> But this is questionable. What is certain
is, that the metal was transported overland to
the Gulf of Lyons long before the Phœnicians passed
the Pillars of Hercules, and was available, much
earlier still, in Egypt and Assyria. The Cornish was
not, then, the first source of supply to be opened, nor
was the Malaccan. Tin was, in fact, an article of
export from Alexandria to India down to the beginning
of the Christian era. The modern discovery, however,
of tin-mines in Khorassan, the ancient Drangiana,
irresistibly suggests that the primitive bronze-workers
derived the less plentiful material of their industry
from the Paropamisus, and tends to confirm the
Turanian lineage imputed to them by Lenormant.<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c017'><b>[340]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The Homeric name for tin, <i>kassiteros</i>, is at any rate
clearly of Oriental origin. The Greeks adopted it from
the Phœnicians; the Phœnicians <i>may</i>, it is thought,
have picked it up from Accadian bronze-smiths along
the shores of the Persian Gulf. It survives in the
Arabic <i>kasdîr</i>, and under the form <i>kastîra</i> made its
way into Sanskrit, on the occasion of Alexander’s
invasion of the Punjâb. Pure tin ranked with Homer
almost as a precious metal. Its scarcity gave it
prestige; but he had evidently very little acquaintance
with its qualities. As Helbig remarks,<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c017'><b>[341]</b></a> difficulties
of interpretation arise wherever <i>kassiteros</i> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>brought on the scene. A good deal of critical discomfort,
for instance, has been created by the statement
that greaves of tin were included in the warlike outfit
supplied to Achilles from Olympus. And bewilderment
is heightened later on by the defensive power
they are made to exhibit in the hardest trials of
actual battle. In point of fact, they would have been
as ineffective as papier-maché against the thrust of
Agenor’s spear; and their clattering would scarcely
have produced the awe-inspiring effect ascribed to it
in the following passage.</p>

and smote him [Achilles] on the leg beneath the knee, nor missed

for the god’s gift drave it back.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c017'><b>[342]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Tin corrodes so readily that its extreme archæological
rarity is not surprising. None has been found,

that poor fishermen attached pieces of it as weights

<p class='c015'>Tin and lead made part of the booty taken in the
land of Midian by the Israelites, as well as of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Asiatic tribute paid to early Egyptian conquerors.
But the lead disposed of by the Achæans of the Iliad
was most likely brought by the Phœnicians from
southern Spain; and the surmise is plausible that
the Homeric word, <i>molubdos</i>—lead—-otherwise isolated
and unexplained, may have been transferred, by the
same agency, from the perishing Iberian to the
vigorous Greek tongue.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c017'><b>[350]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The Greek name for iron, <i>sideros</i>, is equally destitute
of known affinities. It has, indeed, sometimes
been deemed cognate with the Latin <i>sidus</i>, a star, on
the ground that meteoric, or star-sent iron was the
earliest form of the metal made available for human
purposes; but modern philologists do not see their
way to admitting the connexion. The coincidence is
impressive, yet may, none the less, be wholly misleading.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Homeric poems testify to everyday experience
of the powers and faculties of iron. In the
Iliad, knives are made of it, and rustic implements of
all sorts; iron-tipped arrows are sped from tough
bows; iron axes perform the rough work of the forest
and farm-yard. The Odyssean functions of the metal
cover a still wider range. The iron age, just beginning
in the first Epic, has pretty well made good its
footing in the second. Thus, Beloch<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c017'><b>[351]</b></a> has pointed
out that, while <i>chalkos</i> is mentioned 279, <i>sideros</i> only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>23 times in the Iliad, the proportion has become, in
the Odyssey, 80 to 29; and his detailed analysis partially
supports the conclusion that iron comes most
prominently into view in the latest portions of both
poems. Yet no amount of skill in critical carving
can divide off a section of either in which ignorance
of the metal prevails. The differences are only in
degrees of acquaintanceship.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The diversity in this respect between the Odyssey
and Iliad can be perceived at a glance by contrasting
the weapons Odysseus left behind him at Ithaca with
those he wielded before Troy. The first set were of
iron, probably of steel, the existence of which is implied
in the practice of tempering by immersion in
cold water, referred to in connexion with the feat of
plunging a hot stake into the vast orbit of the
Cyclops’ solitary eye.</p>

<p class='c015'>Iron or steel has even reached, in the Odyssey,
the stage of proverbial familiarity as the material for
arms. <i>Sideros</i> stands for sword in a maxim which
may be translated ‘Cold steel masters the man,’<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c017'><b>[353]</b></a> signifying
that when weapons are at hand, bloodshed is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>not far off. In the Iliad, on the contrary, swords
and spears are invariably of bronze; and the commentators’
<i>caveat</i> marks the lines presenting the
iron-headed arrow of Pandarus, and the iron mace of
Areithöus. The passage, too, is not exempt from
their suspicions, in which Achilles offers, as prizes in
the Funeral Games, a ‘massy clod’ of freshly-smelted
iron, and two sets of iron axe-heads.</p>

<p class='c015'>The scanty use made of <i>sideros</i> in the compounding
of Homeric epithets,<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c017'><b>[354]</b></a> no less than its total neglect
in the formation of proper names, is a further argument
for the comparatively late introduction of the
metal. More especially when the plentifulness of
derivatives from <i>chalkos</i> is taken into consideration.
Nevertheless, a good deal of allowance has to be
made, in this matter, for what may be called ethnical
caprice. So the Teutons excluded copper from among
the elements of their local and personal appellations,
while admitting gold and iron; those of the Slavs
were coined from gold, silver, and iron; the Celts
excluding from employment for the purpose all the
metals except iron.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c017'><b>[355]</b></a> More decisive is the designation
of a smith as <i>chalkeus</i>, irrespective of the particular
metal wrought by him, showing that the term had
been fixed when neither gold nor iron, but only
copper or bronze, was welded in Achæan forges. <i>Nam
prior æris fuit quam ferri cognitus usus.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Iron, copper, and gold served as the Homeric media
of exchange. Definitions of value, however, are always
by head of oxen. The golden armour of Glaucus, for
instance, was worth one hundred, the bronze equipment
of Diomed, inconsiderately taken in exchange
by the chivalrous Lycian, no more than nine oxen,<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c017'><b>[356]</b></a>
and the figures may be considered to represent the
proportionate value of those two metals. Iron probably
occupied an intermediate position. It must,
however, have been much cheaper in Ithaca than
in the Troad. For, since the Taphians are said to
have conveyed it in ships to Cyprus, where they
bartered it for copper, it was evidently mined and
smelted in notable quantities on the mainland of
Epirus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Iron has no decorative function in the Homeric
Poems. It contributes nothing to the polymetallic
splendours of the palaces of Menelaus and Alcinous,
of the Shield of Achilles, or of the Breastplate of
Agamemnon. Except where it furnishes an axletree
for the chariot of Heré, it is never employed in
purposeful combination with any other substance.
Esteem, rather than admiration, seems, in fact, to be
considered its due. Its colour is described, usually as
grey, sometimes as violet; and the distinction may
possibly, as has been supposed,<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c017'><b>[357]</b></a> mark the observed
difference between the hoary appearance of newly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>fractured iron, and the bluish gleam of steel blades.
Nevertheless, an arbitrary element in Homeric tints
has often to be admitted. Iron is, however, chiefly
characterised in the Iliad and Odyssey—and with indisputable
justice—as ‘hard to work.’ It demands,
indeed, far more strenuous treatment than its ancient
rival, copper; and the difficulties connected with its
production and working long retarded the prevalence
of its use. Metallurgy advanced but slowly to the
point of being dominated by its influence.</p>

<p class='c015'>Its still earlier diffusion through Greece is only,
then, what might have been expected: and the complete
acquaintance with it manifested in the Homeric
poems conveys, in itself, no presumption of lateness
in their origin. But there are archæological difficulties.
Prehistoric iron is unaccountably scarce in the
neighbourhood of the Ægean. True, it is of a perishable
nature; but where not even a ferruginous stain
survives, it is difficult to believe that objects made out
of iron once existed. Until lately, iron was believed
to be entirely absent from the ruins both at Hissarlik
and Mycenæ, as well as from those of Orchomenos
and Tiryns. But in 1890, Dr. Schliemann, in clearing
the foundations of a building on the Trojan Pergamus,
came upon two lumps of the missing substance;
and some finger-rings composed of it are
among the trophies of the recent excavations carried
on in the lower city of Mycenæ, under the auspices of
the Greek Archæological Society.<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c017'><b>[361]</b></a> But the metal
was then evidently very rare, although the ‘bee-hive
tombs,’ where it was discovered, belong to a later
stage of Mycenæan history than the ‘shaft-graves’ of
the citadel. Still, the gap previously supposed to
divide, at this point, the Homeric from the Mycenæan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>world, has to a certain extent been bridged; and
other discrepancies may, in like manner, be qualified,
if not removed, by further research.</p>

<p class='c015'>The metals chiefly employed in Homeric verse to
typify abstract qualities are bronze and iron. The
Shakespearian use of ‘golden’ to convey delightfulness
of almost any kind, as in the expressions ‘<i>golden</i>
cadence of poesy,’ ‘a <i>golden</i> mind,’ ‘<i>golden</i> joys,’
‘<i>golden</i> sleep,’ and so on, is paralleled only by the
Homeric ‘<i>golden</i> Aphrodite.’ Lead does not exemplify,
with the Greek poet, heaviness and sloth,
nor silver the gentle ripple of sweet sounds. But
death, as ‘a sleep of bronze,’ comes before us in all
its unrelenting sternness; Stentor has a ‘voice of
bronze;’ a ‘memory of bronze’ was needed for exceptional
feats of recitation; and the ‘iron noise’ of
battle went up to a ‘bronzen sky’ during the struggle
ensuing upon the fall of Patroclus. In the Odyssey,
the sky is alternately of bronze and of iron, the same
idea of stability—of a ‘brave, o’erhanging firmament’
being conveyed by both epithets.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c017'><b>[362]</b></a> Moreover, iron is
there the recognised symbol of pitilessness, strength of
mind, and self-command. Odysseus listens, masked
in an ‘aspect of iron,’ while Penelope, strangely
touched by his still unrecognised presence, recites the
weary story of her sorrows. A heart <i>steeled</i>—as we
should say—against pity was said to be ‘of iron,’ as
was that of Achilles against Hector in the days of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>‘iron indignation’ at the slaying of his loved comrade;
and silence and secrecy, even in a woman,
were represented by the rigidity of that unbending
metal. Such metaphors occur, it is true, more frequently
in the Odyssey than in the Iliad; but the
conception upon which they are founded is present
throughout the whole sphere of Homeric thought.
There are, nevertheless, as we have seen, clearly definable
differences, in the matter of metallic acquisitions,
between the two great Epics. The Iliad
knows six, while the Odyssey refers only to four of
these substances, tin and lead not chancing to be
noticed in its cantos; and iron, in their record, has
made a considerable advance upon its Iliadic status.
This is unquestionably a circumstance to be taken
into account in attempting to deal with the Homeric
problem.</p>

</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Man</span> is a tool-shaping animal. He alone infuses
matter with purpose, and so makes it effective for
widening and strengthening his wonderful dominion
over physical nature. What is more, his thoughts
themselves grow with the means at his command, and
their growth in turn inspires a further restless seeking
after instruments of fresh conquests. The first
metal-workers, accordingly, crossed a gulf destined to
divide the ages. It was not for nothing that legendary
honours were paid to them; they were the vague
recognition of a really momentous advance. Its importance
consisted, not so much in the immediate
gain of power, as in the implication of what was to
come. For metallurgy is an art which does not easily
stand still. Even in its crudest stages it demands
some technical skill; and technical skill cannot be
attained without division of labour, differentiation of
classes, and development of intelligence by its direction
into special channels, and towards feasible ends.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>There are, then, few better tests of civilisation than
the degree of command acquired over the metals.</p>

<p class='c015'>The wide compass of metallic qualities was in itself
stimulating to ingenuity. There was always something
new to be found out about them, and they lent
themselves with facility to every variety of treatment.
This versatility contrasted strongly with the rigid and
impracticable nature of the stony substances they
tended to supersede. Thus, the six primitive metals
not only presented, at first sight, a great number
of diverse characteristics, but those characteristics
proved, on the most elementary trials, highly susceptible
of change. They could be surprisingly modified,
for instance, by mutual admixtures, and, in a
lesser degree, by differences of manipulation. Secrets
of the craft hence multiplied, and invited, as they
continue to invite, further experiments and research.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of still greater consequence to civilisation at large
was the comparatively recondite occurrence of the
metals. They are not to be met with, like flints or
pebbles, strewing the bed of every stream; their distribution
is defined and restricted. The demand for
them could, for this reason, only be supplied by opening
long lines of communication; it led to extended
intercourse between nations, and created wants stimulating
to traffic.</p>

<p class='c015'>Metals, besides, present themselves only by exception
in the native state; they are commonly disguised
under some form of ore, subterraneanly bestowed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Nature holds them concealed in her bosom, or at
most attracts the eye with niggardly samples of her
treasures. The very word <i>metal</i>, indeed, records a
‘quest,’ a searching for something hidden; and it is
remarkable that these substances have been least
effective for promoting culture just where they have
come most readily to hand. By the shores of Lake
Superior pure copper can be quarried like sandstone;
and it was, in fact, cut away and hammered into axes
and knives by Indian tribes long before they came
into contact with Europeans. A similar use has been
made of meteoric iron by the Esquimaux. But no
development of ingenuity resulted in either case. And
for this reason among others, that the metal was used
<i>cold</i>. It received essentially the treatment of stone, and
made very much the same kind of response. Because
smelting processes were not needed, forging processes
were not thought of. The furnace was absent,
and with it the power of rendering metals plastic
to human wants and purposes. There was, then,
good warrant for the figuring, as the arch-metallurgist
of mythology, of the incorporated element
of fire.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hephæstus was the Homeric Wayland Smith. He
embodied the antique, universal notion of magic
metallurgy, but embodied it after a dignified manner
suitable to the grand epical standard. Homer was
not given to repeating folk-stories current among the
lower strata of—shall we say?—Pelasgian society.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>His associations were with courts and camps, his
sympathies with heroic achievements and maritime
adventures in distant, perhaps fabulous, countries.
There, indeed, grotesque aboriginal fancies might be
permitted to flourish; but they were excluded as
much as possible from the sunlit spaces of the Hellenic
world. Even here they crept in unbidden, for
the Homeric theology is by no means exempt from
the influence of rustic persuasions. But these were
only admitted after passing through the alembic of
fine fancy or ennobling thought. Thus, Hephæstus,
although he has not wholly put off the semblance of
the ‘drudging goblin’ of caves and cairns, stands for
a formidable nature-power, and possesses the capability
of being sublime. Panting, perspiring, shaggy,
and limping, he is still no dubious divinity, but a
genuine Olympian. His dwelling is on the mountain
of the gods; he shares their councils; his operations
are at the command of none; he is self-directed and
self-inspired with his art, having taken to the hammer
and anvil as spontaneously as the infant Hermes
took to music and thievery. Indeed, the ill-used, yet
not ill-natured, son of Heré surpasses his progenitors
in one important respect. He is the only one of the
Homeric gods in whom some remnant of creative
power remains active. He alone commands a glimmer
of the Promethean spark, half-hidden though it
be in the ashes of material conceptions. Not, indeed,
life in any true sense, but faculties of perception and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>animation are his to give to the works of his hands.
His forge can turn out intelligent automata. Among
its products are golden handmaidens,<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c017'><b>[363]</b></a> conscious without
being self-conscious, endowed with all the useful
attributes, while devoid of the inconveniences of personality.
Their efficiency was purely altruistic; they
acted, but neither sought nor suffered. The bellows,
too, of the great Iliadic armourer could be left to blow
at discretion; and his wheeled tripods repaired to, and
withdrew from, the assembly of the gods, at fit times,
unsummoned and undismissed. This lingering of the
creative tradition, completely dissociated from the
mighty Zeus, about the misshapen nursling of Thetis,
illustrates his connexion with Pthah, the creative
and at the same time the metallurgical deity of the
Nile-valley.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r363'>363</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ilmarine, the Finnish Hephæstus, made himself a wife of gold.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The Teutonic Wieland sprang from the same
mythological stock. He could, however, lay claim to
no trait of divinity, but was merely an artist of
supreme skill, taught by subterranean pygmies. He
was lamed by King Nidung, an early art-patron,
eager for a monopoly of his services; but eventually
escaped by means of a flying-apparatus of his own
construction, his maladroit brother Ægil barely escaping
the fate of Icarus. Here, then, Wieland
merges into Dædalus, who is only once mentioned by
Homer, and that as a builder. In a passage full of
the ‘local colour’ of Crete, he is said to have constructed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>the ‘chorus,’ or dancing-place of Ariadne.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c017'><b>[364]</b></a>
The dream of a levitative art lurked nowhere within
the Homeric field of view. Least of all had it been
mastered by the ‘eternal smith’ of Olympus, who
owed his life-long infirmity to the want of a parachute.
His ‘summer’s day’ fall from the ‘crystal battlements’
of Olympus ‘on Lemnos, th’ Ægean isle,’
crippled him incurably; and his return thither was
effected by other than aeronautic means. But the
story of his alliance with Dionysus is not Homeric, so
we have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Still less Homeric is the comparatively late account
of his localisation in the Lipari Islands:</p>

</div>

<p class='c024'>And yet it is worth recalling, as evidence that the
prime metallurgists of Northern and Southern Europe
were offshoots from the same stem. Every one knows
that, in the days of old, travellers’ horses were wont
to be privily shod, ‘for a consideration,’ at a cromlech
at Ashbury in Berkshire,<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c017'><b>[365]</b></a> by a certain ‘Wayland
Smith,’ who had no doubt his own reasons for eschewing
public observation. It seems, however, from the
testimony of Pytheas, a Massilian Greek of Alexander’s
epoch, that the Liparine Hephæstus conducted himself
in just the same kind of way.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c017'><b>[366]</b></a> He worked invisibly,
but could be hired to do any given job. This shows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>a marked decline from his palmy Iliadic days, when
his services might by exception be had for love, but
never for money. From the position of a god, he had
sunk to that of a mere mercenary troll or kobold.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the Achæans at the time of the siege of
Troy, works in metal<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c017'><b>[367]</b></a> of traditional repute were
ascribed to Hephæstus no less freely than swords and
cuirasses in the Middle Ages to Wieland or his French
equivalent, Galand, or than fiddles in later days to
Straduarius. A Wieland’s sword, first brandished by
Alexander the Great, was said to have been transmitted
successively to Ptolemy, Judas Maccabæus, and
Vespasian; Charlemagne’s ‘Durandal’ and Taillefer’s
‘Durissima’ were from his master-hand, which armed
as well the prowess of Julius Cæsar, and Godfrey of
Bouillon. Part at least of the armour of Beowulf
was also from the cavernous northern workshop which
reproduced the forge on Mount Olympus, where the
behest of Thetis was carried into execution; and to
this day in Kurdistan King David is believed to
labour, in a desolate sepulchre among the hills, at
hauberks, greaves, and cuirasses.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c017'><b>[368]</b></a></p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>dead body of Patroclus. Only the shield, however,

<p class='c024'>wrought in gold, silver, tin, and enamel on a bronze
surface. The implements at hand were hammer,
anvil, tongs, and bellows. A self-supporting furnace—we
hear of no fuel—contained crucibles, in which the
metals were rendered plastic by heat, but not, it would
appear, melted. The bronze used was presumably
ready-made.<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c017'><b>[369]</b></a> Processes of alloying, like processes of
mining and smelting, are ignored in the Homeric
poems. They seem to have lain outside the range
of ordinary Achæan experience, and can have been
carried on only to a very limited extent on Greek soil,
and there, perhaps, by foreigners. No part of the
‘clypei non enarrabile textum’ was cast. Forged
throughout, inlaid and embossed, it was a piece of
work of which the great Mulciber had no reason to be
ashamed.</p>

<p class='c015'>The technique employed by him has, within the
last few years, received a curiously apposite illustration.
The Homeric description is of a series of
vignettes depicted by means of polymetallic combinations,
in a manner wholly alien to the practice of
historic antiquity. But now prehistoric antiquity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>has come to the rescue of the commentators’ perplexity.
From the graves at Mycenæ were dug out
some rusty dagger-blades, which proved, on being
cleaned and polished at Athens, to be skilfully ornamented
in coloured metallic intarsiatura. The ground
is of bronze, prepared with a kind of black enamel for
the reception of figures cut out of gold-leaf tinted of
various shades, from silvery-white to copper-red, the
details being brought out with a graver.<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c017'><b>[370]</b></a> Groups
of men and animals, mostly in rapid motion, are thus
depicted with considerable vigour, and forcibly recall
the naturalistic effects suggested by the plastic power
of the poet. ‘On these blades,’ Mr. Gardner remarks,<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c017'><b>[371]</b></a>
‘we find fishes of dark gold swimming in a stream of
pale gold; drops of blood are represented by inserted
spots of red gold; in some cases silver is used. What
could be nearer to Homer’s golden vines with silver
props, or his oxen of gold and tin?’</p>

<p class='c015'>This peculiar kind of damascening work was completely
forgotten before the classical age. It seems
to have originated in Egypt at least as early as
1600 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c017'><b>[372]</b></a> and Egyptian influences are palpable both
in the decorative designs on the Mycenæan blades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>and in the mode of their execution. The papyrus,
for instance, is conspicuous in a riverside scene.
Nevertheless, these remarkable objects were certainly
not imported. They were wrought by native artists
inspired by Egyptian models. The freedom and boldness
with which the subjects chosen for portrayal are
treated make this practically certain. A specimen of
the same style of work, brought from the island of
Thera (now Santorin) to the Museum of Copenhagen,
suffices to show that acquaintance with it was at one
time pretty widely diffused through the Ægean archipelago,
and hence cannot serve to localise the origin
of the Homeric poems.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f372'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r372'>372</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘A sword exactly in the style of the Mycenæan blades was taken
from the grave of Aa Hotep, the mother of Ah Mose, who freed
Egypt, about 1600 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, from the Hyksos.’—Schuchhardt, <i>op. cit.</i>
p. 316.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In its entirety, the Shield of Achilles was beyond
doubt an ideal creation. The poet described something
imaginatively apprehended as the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>
of a superhuman artist, but claiming no existence out
of the shining realm of fancy. Only the elements
of the creation were taken from reality. The idea
dominating its construction, of moulding a work of
art into a comprehensive world-picture, is eminently
Oriental. It recurs in the mantle of Demetrius Poliorcetes,
and, more or less abortively, in various Indian
and Moorish embroideries. And the arrangement of
the sequence of scenes in concentric circles on the
‘vast circumference’ of the ‘orbed shield’ was certainly
copied from Assyrio-Phœnician models.</p>

<p class='c015'>In its manufacture no iron was employed; and
this was quite in accordance with Homeric usage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>The latest metallic acquisition of the fore-time boasted
no traditional consecration; it could impart neither
beauty nor splendour; the part its nature assigned to
it was one of prosaic usefulness. It is accordingly
excluded from the Mycenæan scheme of ornament
imitated in the Shield, and may, indeed, have been
unknown to the artists by whom that scheme was
elaborated. The Olympian Demiurgus, at any rate,
was acquainted with no such substance; but then the
gods of Greece were never quick to adopt new improvements.
So far as Homer tells us, the only
Olympian use of iron was in the chariot of Heré, thus
described in the Fifth Iliad:</p>

<p class='c022'>And Hebe quickly put to the car the curved wheels of
bronze, eight-spoked, upon their axletree of iron. Golden is
their felloe, imperishable, and tires of bronze are fitted thereover,
a marvel to look upon; and the naves are of silver, to turn
about on either side. And the car is plaited tight with gold
and silver thongs, and two rails run round about it. And the
silver pole stood out therefrom; upon the end bound she the
fair golden yoke, and set thereon the fair breast-straps of
gold.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c017'><b>[373]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f373'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>This passage shows, as Dr. Leaf points out,<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c017'><b>[374]</b></a> that
the chariots of those times, being very light, were, in
the intervals of use, taken to pieces and laid by on
stands. That they were then covered with linen
cloths is told to us elsewhere in the Iliad. Not all
were furnished with eight-spoked wheels. The emphasis
laid upon the fact as regards the goddess’s car
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>indicates that it was exceptional; and the indication
is confirmed by the four-spoked wheels of every
vehicle in the Mycenæan reliefs. As to the iron
axletree, it was plainly meant, not for show, but for
strength; yet its introduction, even in that humble
capacity, among the appurtenances of a divine being,
can scarcely have been warranted by prescription,
and may have appeared a no less daring innovation
than the serving-out of gunpowder to the infernal
host in ‘Paradise Lost.’</p>

<p class='c015'>Homeric archæology has assumed a new aspect
since the opening of the prehistoric graves at
Mycenæ. The doubts of centuries have now at last
met a criterion of truth; the debates of centuries are
in many cases already virtually closed. And this is
only a beginning. If the spade be the best commentator,
it will hardly be laid aside until further light
has been thrown upon still twilight places in Homeric
controversy. What has been done is indeed surprising
enough. Not very rarely, what might pass—allowing
for some slight poetical amplification—for the originals
of implements or utensils described in the Epics, have
been unearthed in the course of the excavations begun
by Dr. Schliemann. Among them is an excellent
model, on a reduced scale, of Nestor’s Cup, an acquisition
almost as surprising as would have been the
recovery of Jason’s Mantle, or Penelope’s Web.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Pramnian beverage prepared by the skilled
Hecamede for the refreshment of Nestor and Machaon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>was served in ‘a right goodly cup that the old man
brought from home, embossed with studs of gold, and
four handles there were to it; and round each two
golden doves were feeding; and to the cup were two
feet below.’<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c017'><b>[375]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The golden beaker now, after three millenniums
of sepulture, exhibited in the Polytechnicon at Athens,<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c017'><b>[376]</b></a>
has two, instead of two pairs of dove-surmounted
handles; but the support of each by a separate prop
riveted on to the base, corresponds strictly to the
construction with ‘two feet below’ (πυθμένες), as
described in the Iliad. The real and imagined
objects unmistakably belong to the same class and
epoch, and their agreement is in itself strong evidence
of coherence between Homeric and Mycenæan civilisation.
The ‘studs of gold’ embossing the Nestorean
drinking-cup were doubtless the ornamental heads of
the nails used as rivets. The art of soldering, in
the proper sense, was a later discovery;<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c017'><b>[377]</b></a> but the
Mycenæan goldsmith sometimes had recourse to a
cement of borax for fastening pieces of gold together.
In general, however, decorative adjuncts were separately
cast, and afterwards attached with rivets to the
objects they were intended to embellish. In this way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>probably, the purely ornamental use of metallic knobs
and bosses grew up. The Homeric epithets ‘silver-studded’
and ‘bossy,’ applied to sword-sheaths,
chairs, and shields, have been copiously illustrated
by the discovery at Mycenæ of innumerable gold, or
rather gilt, discs and buttons, which had evidently
once formed the adornment of the sheaths and shields
lying alongside.<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c017'><b>[378]</b></a> At Olympia, too, bronze sheathings
have been found set with rows of solid silver nails,<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c017'><b>[379]</b></a>
by means of which they may have been fastened to
chairs of the exact type of those described in the
Iliad.</p>

<p class='c015'>For his effects of palatial splendour, Homer relied
all but exclusively on the metals. Upholstery was for
him non-existent. Small carpets for placing under
the feet of distinguished persons, and rugs for their
beds, were the utmost luxuries known to him in this
line, and they were mere individual appurtenances.
But for producing general effects, his means were
exceedingly limited. He could dispose neither of rich
draperies, nor of silken hangings. Polished and rare
woods lay outside his acquaintance; the marbles of
Paros and Pentelicus had not yet been quarried;
porphyry, jasper, alabaster, and all other kinds of
ornamental stones seem to have been strange to him.
Not so much as a coat of plaster, or a dash of distemper,
clothed the bareness of his walls. Floors of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>trodden earth, rafters blackened with smoke, chimneyless
and windowless apartments, belonged even to the
royal residences of his time, at least in Ithaca. But
in a few of the more opulent houses of the Peloponnesus,
something was done to dispel this sordid aspect
by means of metallic incrustations; and the possibility
was made the most of by the poet. Nor need the
looks of Mammon have been ‘always downward bent’
in the radiant dwellings imagined by him, since their
riches lay on every side. They are, in the Iliad,
appropriated exclusively to the gods, and are vaguely
characterised as ‘golden,’ or ‘of bronze,’ all details
of construction being omitted. But the terrene
magnificence of the Odyssey is more distinctly
realised.</p>

<p class='c015'>His experienced sire was little less astonished at
the pomp surrounding the Phæacian king. All the
‘cities of men’ visited by him in the progress of his

of Alcinous, and his heart was full of many thoughts as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>stood there, or ever he had reached the threshold of bronze.
For there was a gleam as it were of sun or moon through the
high-roofed hall of great-hearted Alcinous. Brazen were the
walls which ran this way and that from the threshold to the
inmost chamber, and round them was a frieze of blue, and
golden were the doors that closed in the good house. Silver
were the doorposts that were set on the brazen threshold, and
silver the lintel thereupon, and the hook of the door was of
gold. And on either side stood golden hounds and silver, which
Hephæstus wrought by his cunning, to guard the palace of
great-hearted Alcinous, being free from death and age all their
days.... Yea, and there were youths fashioned in gold,
standing on firm-set bases, with flaming torches in their hands,
giving light through the night to the feasters in the palace.’<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c017'><b>[382]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Both here, and at Sparta, besides perhaps some
gilding of smaller surfaces with overlaid gold-leaf, the
stone and woodwork of the houses can be understood
to have been coated with metal plates—a mode of
decoration usual in Mesopotamia from a very early
date. Thus, the temple of Bel at Babylon had its
walls covered with silver and ivory, while the shimmer
of gold came from pavement and roof.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c017'><b>[383]</b></a> The fashion
was adopted in Egypt, and spread to Asia Minor, perhaps
through the conquests of Ramses II., who built
at Abydos a temple to Osiris, plated with ‘silver-gold.’
It was diffused as well among the pre-Dorian Greeks.
Both the so-called ‘Treasury of Minyas’ at Orchomenus,
and the ‘Treasury of Atreus’ at Mycenæ,
bear evident traces of having once been scale-plated
with bronze, not, it is thought, uniformly, but in fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>patterns.<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c017'><b>[384]</b></a> So, here again, archæological research
supplies the most instructive gloss upon the Homeric
text. Metallic incrustations lost their charm when
tinted marbles and manifold draperies had become
fully available; but a glint of their traditional
splendour was introduced by Plato into his Atlantis,
where the temple of Poseidon was lined interiorly
with the semi-mythical ‘orichalcum’ (later identified
with brass), dug up appropriately in great profusion
from the soil of a fabulous island.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c017'><b>[385]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The watch-dogs of Alcinous find analogues in the
pairs of sphinxes, winged bulls, or other nondescript
monsters, guarding Egyptian and Assyrian portals.
There is nothing to show that they possessed automatic
powers. In those unsophisticated times, works
of consummate imitative skill would readily take rank
as samples of magic metallurgy; and what was life-like
so inevitably suggested animation, that the distinction
could scarcely be drawn very clearly.
Similarly, the torch-bearers in the banqueting-hall
may be regarded as poetical anticipations of the Greek
art of statuary, then still unborn, or at most in
swaddling-clothes.</p>

<p class='c015'>One of the rarities brought by Helen with her
from Egypt to Sparta was a silver basket, mounted
on wheels, for holding the wool which she industriously
span into thread.<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c017'><b>[386]</b></a> Now wheeled utensils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>were presumably a Phœnician invention, since they
are mentioned among the furniture of Solomon’s
Temple (1 Kings vii.). Their occurrence in prehistoric
Greece is hence one of many proofs of Oriental
influence. The Iliad knows them as the handiwork
of Hephæstus, who facilitated by means of subjacent
wheels, the movements of his intelligent tripods; and
Homeric indications have been substantiated by the
unearthing, in the Altis at Olympia, of remnants of
objects belonging, apparently, to the same category.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c017'><b>[387]</b></a>
Others, probably incense-pans, were found, a quarter
of a century ago, in tombs of great antiquity at

<p class='c015'>Helen’s silver workbasket was gilt round the
edges, like the ‘crater,’ or mixing-bowl, presented by
Menelaus as a ‘guest-gift’ to Telemachus.<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c017'><b>[389]</b></a> The latter
was a work of Hephæstus, and had been presented to
Menelaus by the king of Sidon, when he was driven
thither on his way back from Troy. The process of
gilding, however, is well known in the Odyssey, and
was practised by native craftsmen. In the scene of
Nestor’s sacrifice at Pylos,<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c017'><b>[390]</b></a> the goldsmith Laerkes is
summoned to gild the horns of the victim, which he
evidently did by the simple expedient of overlaying
them with gold-leaf. Fusion had indeed not yet been
resorted to for the purpose; nevertheless the art of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>plating silver with gold, to which is compared the
beautifying action of Athene upon Odysseus, in order
to his advantageous appearance before Nausicaa,<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c017'><b>[391]</b></a>
excites the extreme personal admiration of the poet,
and is regarded as a direct fruit of divine tuition.
And it is noticeable that the artists of Mycenæ,
although in most respects far above the Homeric
standard, found the operation of plating silver directly
with gold so difficult that they commonly interposed
a layer of copper to receive the more precious metal.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c017'><b>[392]</b></a></p>

<p class='c015'>No gilt objects are expressly mentioned in the
Iliad,<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c017'><b>[393]</b></a> but the delineative inlaying of the Shield of
Achilles involved the same sort of process as that
required for producing them. The Iliadic Hephæstus,
however, was somewhat behind his time. For the
‘latest thing out,’ one would be inclined to look elsewhere.
He was, as we have seen, unacquainted with
iron, and his models were often a trifle archaic.
From the very outset of his career, when, as an infant
and a foundling, he was cared for by Thetis and
Eurynome, the divine artificer appears to have been

<p class='c015'>The armour of Agamemnon was of foreign manufacture.
Cinyras, king of Cyprus, of semi-mythical
fame as a metallurgist, had sent it to him, perhaps as
a pledge of benevolent neutrality,<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c017'><b>[396]</b></a> at any rate, more
through fear than love. It was of a highly decorative
character, being inlaid and embossed with gold
and tin, silver and enamel. Fundamentally, of
course, it was, like all Homeric armour, of bronze.
Something further will be said about it in the next
Chapter.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Brooch of Odysseus, on the other hand, might
have been wrought within the Achæan realm. It was
besides in his possession before his foreign wanderings
began, and we are not told that it was procured from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>abroad. At his setting out from Ithaca for Troy, it
is said that:</p>

<p class='c022'>Goodly Odysseus wore a thick purple mantle, twofold, which
had a brooch fashioned in gold, with a double covering for the
pins, and on the face of it was a curious device; a hound in his
forepaws held a dappled fawn and gazed on it as it writhed.
And all men marvelled at the workmanship, how, wrought as
they were in gold, the hound was gazing on the fawn and
strangling it, and the fawn was writhing with his feet and
striving to flee.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c017'><b>[399]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The brooch, it is to be observed, was duplex. Two
pins were received into two confronting tubes, opening
opposite ways. The mechanism is exemplified in
the ‘pin and tube’ fastening of some golden diadems
from Mycenæ;<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c017'><b>[400]</b></a> and, still more perfectly, in certain
brooches exhumed at Præneste and Cære, each provided
with two pins running into a pair of tubular
sheaths, a kind of hook-and-eye arrangement behind
serving to retain them in that position.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c017'><b>[401]</b></a> These were
associated with a multitude of articles, known to be
of Phœnician manufacture, imported into Etruria
during the sixth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; but the stolid sphinxes
surmounting them were replaced, in the Ithacan
ornament, by a life-like representation, conceived in
the true Greek spirit, although deriving its motive
from the typical Oriental group of a lion tearing an
ox, or deer.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c017'><b>[402]</b></a> This, however, had become so naturalised
in Mycenæan art as by no means in itself to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>imply a foreign origin; and the same remark applies
to the mechanism of the Odyssean fibula. The poet
certainly regarded it as a rare specimen of superlative
skill; but the like of it may not improbably yet be
unearthed from Greek soil.</p>

<p class='c015'>Smiths are not included among the Homeric
<i>demiurgi</i>. The class of persons specially distinguished
for their serviceableness to the community is
made up of physicians, soothsayers, carpenters, and
poets. Nevertheless, there were metal-workers in
Ithaca who might have competed in general utility
with the best of the native wizards. A smithy, described
as a place of common resort, was situated close
to the Odyssean palace; and the demand for spears,
swords, axes, and knives must have been continual,
and was certainly met by a local supply. There is
much doubt, however, as to whether objects claiming
an artistic character were produced in Ithaca. It
seems more likely, on the whole, that the few existing
there had been imported from the Peloponnesus.
There, presumably, Nestor’s Cup, stated to have been
brought by him from Pylos to Troy, was manufactured;
and the Brooch of Odysseus might very well
have been turned out from the same workshop. It
is true that a Peloponnesian origin is never expressly
attributed to objects for which particular admiration
is sought to be enlisted. Such are either left undetermined,
claimed for Hephæstus, or said to have
come from Egypt, Sidon, or Cyprus. Achæan was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>thus plainly ranked below foreign industry. And
this in itself indicates a falling off from the ‘golden
prime’ of Mycenæ, when Achæan craftsmen were, to
say the least, not utterly below compare with those of
lands earlier illuminated by the rising sun of civilisation.
Hence, products of everyday familiarity to
Agamemnon had become strange and wonderful to
his <i>sacer vates</i>; yet the abounding vitality has not
left them. They come before us in his songs, animated
with the energy of his thought, fragments of
palpitating life, true prognostics of the perfect art
which the future was to bring to Greece.</p>

<p class='c015'>Homeric metallurgy thus plainly represents a
declining stage of Mycenæan metallurgy; and this
again included conspicuous elements from Egyptian,
Phœnician, and Phrygian sources. Of the two first
springs of influence, our poet shows full consciousness,
but none of the last; since his admiration for
spiral patterns, derived, according to the best authorities,
from the banks of the Sangarius, came to him
at second-hand from Mycenæ. The metallurgical
traditions of Phrygia find, moreover, no place in
his verses. The dæmonic artificers of Asia Minor—the
hammer-and-anvil goblins, sons or servants of
Hephæstus, who of old intangibly colonised the shores
and islands of the Levant, make no figure in the
Iliad or Odyssey. Cabiri, Curetes, Corybantes, Idæan
Dactyls, Rhodian Telchines, are all equally ignored
in the Homeric world. Hephæstus there works alone.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>He has neither aides-de-camp nor coadjutors, apart
from his spontaneously helpful bellows. His predilection
for Lemnos was obviously due to the existence
there of an active volcano; for Mosychlus did not
become extinct until about the time of Alexander the
Great. He, however, consulted perhaps in the choice
rather his primitive elemental character than his
derived industrial function. The establishment of
Cyclopean forges in the craters of volcanoes seems to
have been a mythological after-thought. Its appropriateness
did not at any rate strike Homer. He
indeed betrays no direct acquaintance with subterranean
fires. His Island of the Cyclops is entirely
devoid of volcanic associations, and indeed the genealogy
of Polyphemus was scarcely consistent with any
such relationship. He sprang from Poseidon; and
Poseidon’s wrath at the evil entreatment by Odysseus
of his amiable offspring was a main factor in the
development of the subsequent narrative. For the
resentment of the sea-god was not to be trifled with
by hero or mariner who had slipped unawares into
that outer region of much sea and little land, where
he reigned supreme. <i>Hinc illæ lachrymæ.</i></p>

Their copious gummy exudations had the leisure of

found in the graves there. All were perforated, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>they had manifestly once been connected together to
form necklaces. And the remains of amber necklaces
have likewise been disinterred from the archaic tombs
of Præneste and Veii,<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c017'><b>[406]</b></a> from British barrows, and
from a prehistoric necropolis at Hallstadt in Austria.
The earliest Italian amber seems to have been conveyed
from the Gulf of Lyons along the Ligurian
coast; but a subsequent and more lasting stream of
supply flowed directly to the Po-delta from near the
site of Dantzic. Among the early Italian specimens,
are some neck-pendants carved into the forms of
apes, necessarily from Oriental models in a different
material—most likely, ivory.</p>

<p class='c015'>The particular and widespread preference for
amber as a means of decorating the throat had a
superstitious motive. An idea somehow originated
that the substance, thus worn, was potent against
malefic agencies, and the persuasion doubtless accompanied
it on its travels, and added to its popularity.
There is, to be sure, no sign that Homer, though he
only employs amber in the fitting shape for its exercise,
had any knowledge of this prophylactic power;
but then his indifference to rustic lore has repeatedly
come to our notice. Penelope, however, and the
ladies of Mycenæ, may have been less unconcerned on
the point, and perhaps gave some credence to the
rumours of mysterious virtue that enhanced the value
of the beautiful shining substance from the dim North.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>That their amber was truly hyberborean has been
chemically demonstrated. Fragments of Mycenæan
beads, analysed for Dr. Schliemann by Dr. O. Helm,
of Dantzic, proved to contain no less than 6 per cent.
of succinic acid; and the presence of succinic acid is
distinctive, for ‘there has been no instance hitherto,’
Dr. Helm states, ‘of a product physically and chemically
identical with the Baltic amber being found in
another spot.’<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c017'><b>[407]</b></a> The characteristic ingredient in
question, for instance, is wholly wanting in Sicilian
amber, a fact strongly confirmatory of the historically
attested insignificance, in Mediterranean traffic, of
small local supplies. Tin and amber thus agree in
testifying to the wide extension, westward and northward,
of prehistoric trade; yet the first of these far-travelled
materials occurs in the Iliad, and is absent
from the Odyssey, while the second figures in the
Odyssey, but has no place in the Iliad.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Greek name for amber, <i>elektron</i>, might be
freely translated ‘sun-stone,’ a meaning partially
preserved in the Latin term <i>lapis ardens</i>, Teutonicised
into <i>Brennstein</i>, or <i>Bernstein</i>. The English <i>amber</i>
is a loan from the Arabic, negotiated at the time
of the Crusades; but the original Achæan word
survives in <i>electricity</i> and its derivatives. For the
first production of that still mysterious agency was
by rubbing a piece of amber, the endowment of which
thereby with an attractive faculty for light objects was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>noted with no particular emphasis by Thales, the sage
of Miletus.</p>

<p class='c015'>The ‘Electrides Insulæ,’ or ‘amber-islands,’ of the
ancients, corresponded, in vagueness of geographical
position, with the Cassiterides or ‘tin-islands,’ of which
the Phœnicians long kept the secret. The former
were eventually located in the Adriatic, whither the
historical Greeks succeeded in tracing the Baltic product,
transported in those later days, along a second
overland route from the Vistula to the Danube, and
thence, by intermediary Venetian tribes, to the Istrian
shore. Yet Herodotus was without any definite notion
as to the derivation of amber, one of his spasmodical
fits of scepticism forbidding him to admit its reported
origin from a river called the Eridanus, said to flow
into the sea somewhere at the back of the North
wind.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c017'><b>[408]</b></a> The Eridanus, in fact, had a ‘name’ long
before it had a ‘local habitation.’ Æschylus was
doubtfully inclined to identify it with the Rhone,
showing that he was chiefly acquainted with amber
shipped at Massilia;<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c017'><b>[409]</b></a> Pherecydes, knowing more of
Adriatic supplies, established the ‘fluviorum rex
Eridanus,’ in the bed of the Po, where it has remained.
The myth of the Heliadæ, or sun-maidens, who, after
their merciful transformation into poplars, continued to
weep tears of amber for the fate of their brother, the
lucklessly ambitious Phaethon, took definite shape in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>the hands of the Attic tragedians. Homer gives no
hint of acquaintance with it.</p>

<p class='c015'>The decorative use of amber disappeared from
classical Greece. It had been adopted from the East,
as part of a semi-barbaric system of ornament, and
was abandoned on the development of a purer taste.
The substance was, indeed, as Helbig has remarked,<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c017'><b>[410]</b></a>
ill-adapted for the expression of artistic ideas, and so
had little value for those who directed towards the
achievement of such expression their best efforts for
the ennoblement and refinement of life. No amber,
then, is found in the tombs of the Hellenic Greeks,
nor in those of the Cimmerian Bosphorus, where the
Milesian colony Panticapæum held the primacy.
Even in Italy, the once prized product was left to be
largely appropriated by Gallic barbarians and Istrian
and Umbrian peasants. But the ‘whirligig of time,’
as usual, ‘brought about its revenges.’ As artistic
feeling decayed, the favour of amber returned, and it
grew under the Empire to a higher pitch than it had
ever before attained. Whereupon a cavalier was despatched
from Nero’s court on an exploratory expedition
to the original and genuine home of the article;
direct trade was opened with the Baltic, and the
morning mists which had so long enveloped the origin
of the ‘sun-stone’ were at length dispersed. Nevertheless,
Pausanias, who saw an amber statue of
Augustus at Olympia in the second century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>believed the rare substance composing it to have been
collected from the sands of Eridanus.<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c017'><b>[411]</b></a> Traditional

<p class='c015'>Both in the Iliad and Odyssey, Homer shows
perfect familiarity with ivory. But he is entirely
unconscious of its source. No rumour of the elephant
had reached him. He would surely, if it had, have
shared the surprising intelligence with his hearers.
In the judicious words of Pausanias,<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c017'><b>[412]</b></a> he would never
have passed by an elephant to discourse of cranes
and pygmies. The <i>début</i> in Europe of the strange
great beast ensued, in point of fact, only upon the
Indian campaign of Alexander. His tusks were,
however, in prehistoric demand all through the
East; and the relations of archaic Greeks were
almost exclusively Oriental. Assyrian ivory-carvings
enjoyed a just celebrity; the palaces of Nineveh
and Babylon were softly splendid with the subdued
lustre of their costly material. Solomon’s ivory
throne, and Ahab’s ivory house exemplify its profuse
availability in Palestine; Tyrian galleys were fitted
with ivory-bound cross-benches; musical instruments
were ivory-dight and wrought; ebony and ivory
furniture made part of the tribute of Ethiopia to
Egypt; and the spoils of Indian elephants were in
demand in Italy before the Etruscans had penetrated
the Cisalpine plain. Thus, gold, silver, amber, ivory,
and coloured glass combined with beautiful effect in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>kind of so-called ‘Tyrrhene’ ornaments, extant specimens
of which have been taken from the Regulini-Galassi
tomb, and other coeval repositories.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c017'><b>[413]</b></a> In Troy
and Mycenæ, ivory was relatively plentiful. Pins
and buckles were made of it, and perhaps the handles
of knives and daggers.<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c017'><b>[414]</b></a> Ivory plates, round and rectangular,
and perforated, in some cases, for attachment
to wood or leather, have been, in both spots,
sifted out from surrounding <i>débris</i>, and may be imaginatively
supposed to have once enriched the horse-trappings
of Hector or one of the Pelopides. The
art of carving in ivory, however, was in both these
places in a rude stage, and appears unfamiliar to
Homer. He barely recognises the use of the material
in substantive constructions, while availing himself of
it freely for veneering and inlaying. The only piece of
solid ivory met with in the poems is the handle of
the ‘key of bronze’ with which Penelope opened the
upper chamber to take thence the fateful bow of
Odysseus.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c017'><b>[415]</b></a> For the sheath of the silver-hilted dagger
given to the Ithacan stranger by the Phæacian Euryalus,<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c017'><b>[416]</b></a>
was assuredly not <i>formed</i> of ivory, although
spirally decorated with it. This can be gathered
from the re-application, in the Iliad, of the same
phrase to designate the ornamentation with tin laid on
in a curving pattern, of the cuirass of Asteropæus;<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c017'><b>[417]</b></a>

Artemis or golden Aphrodite, and they set a chair for her hard
by the fire, where she was wont to sit, a chair deftly turned and

<p class='c015'>The chest of Cypselus must have been an analogous
piece of work, though more highly elaborated;
and the ‘beds of ivory,’ denounced by the Prophet
with the rest of the ostentatious luxury in which
Jerusalem attempted to vie with haughty Tyre, may
have displayed similar ornamental designs. In the
Homeric palace of Menelaus, an ideal of splendour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>exotic in the West, but fitting in naturally with
Oriental surroundings, was sought to be realised.
Some such model doubtless floated before the eyes of
the poet as the house of Ahab, magnificent with
panellings of that loveliest of organic substances
bartered by the ‘men of Dedan’ for the finely-wrought
bronze, the purple-dyed and embroidered
cloths of Phœnicia. <i>Domus Indo dente nitescit.</i></p>

<p class='c024'>It has been conjectured that the imperfect transparency
of laminæ, whether of horn or ivory, caused

it must be admitted that scarcely a worse pair of puns
could be produced from the whole of Shakespeare’s
plays than those perpetrated by our ‘bonus Homerus’

largely turned to account by his successors.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is scarcely likely that complete tusks ever
found their way to archaic Greece, yet the comparison—used
twice in the Odyssey—of purely white
objects to ‘fresh-cut ivory,’ decidedly proves a working
acquaintance with the material. Its creamy tint
was, in Egypt and Assyria, constantly set off by
skilful intermixture with ebony; but ebony formed
no part of the Homeric stock-in-trade.</p>

<p class='c015'>One cannot but be struck by finding that, in the
Iliad, ivory is employed <i>only</i> for embellishing equine
accoutrements, but in the Odyssey, <i>only</i> for purposes
of domestic decoration. So far as it goes, this circumstance
tends to reinforce the contrast of sentiment
towards the horse apparent in the two poems.
Thus, a species of art practised, we are given to
understand, exclusively by foreigners, helps to conjure
up more vividly the effect of the rush of crimson
blood over the white skin of the fair-haired Menelaus:
‘As when some woman of Maionia or Karia staineth
ivory with purple to make a cheek-piece for horses,
and it is laid up in the treasure-chamber, though
many a horseman prayeth to wear it; but it is laid
up to be a king’s boast, alike an adornment for his
horse, and a glory for his charioteer.’<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c017'><b>[422]</b></a> And the
simile was adopted by Virgil to expound a blush.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Ivory-staining does not seem to have been in
vogue outside of Asia Minor. Tablets of ivory were,
at Nineveh, often inlaid with lapis lazuli, and ornaments
of ivory were gilt; but there are no surviving
signs of the application to them of colouring matters.</p>

<p class='c015'>The second mention of ivory in the Iliad is in
connexion with the slaying, by Menelaus, of Pylæmenes,
chief of the ‘bucklered Paphlagonians,’ when
it is said that Antilochus simultaneously smote his
charioteer Mydon with a great stone on the elbow,
and ‘the reins, white with ivory, fell from his hands
to earth, even into the dust.’<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c017'><b>[423]</b></a> The overlaying, in a
decorative design, of leathern bands with small slips
and rosettes of ivory, may here doubtless be understood;
and a similar fashion of lending splendour to
horse-trappings can, as already pointed out, plausibly
be inferred to have prevailed at Hissarlik.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f423'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r423'>423</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Iliad</i>, v. 583.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Homer’s name for ivory is identical with ours for
the beast producing it for our benefit. And the word
<i>elephant</i> is held to be cognate with the Hebrew <i>aleph</i>,
an ox. Hence the designation came to the Greeks
almost certainly from a Semitic source. It was exported,
we may unhesitatingly say, from Phœnicia
with the wares it served to label.</p>

<p class='c015'>No Homeric crux has been more satisfactorily
disposed of by actual exploration than that relating
to the identity of ‘cyanus,’ or ‘kuanos.’ In later
Greek, the term was of perfectly clear import. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>signified lapis lazuli, either genuine or counterfeit.
But the simple hypothesis of a continuity of meaning
was met by difficulties of two kinds. The first
regarded colour, always a perplexed subject in the
Homeric poems. For uniformly, throughout their
course, ‘cyanean’ betokens darkness of hue, if not
absolute blackness. The epithet frequently recurs,
and only once with a possible, though doubtful suggestion
of <i>blueness</i>. It is never used to qualify the
summer sea, a serene sky, the eyes of a fair woman,
or the flowers of spring. Usually, the idea of sombreness,
pure and simple, is unequivocally attached
to it. As when Thetis, in sign of mourning, covers
herself with a cyanus-coloured robe, ‘than which no
blacker raiment existed.’<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c017'><b>[424]</b></a> Invisibility and the shade
of approaching death are each typified as a ‘cyanean
cloud’; the brows of Zeus and Heré, the waving
locks of Poseidon, the mane of the Poseidonian
steed Areion, the gathering tempest of war, are
of ‘cyanean’ darkness; the beard of Odysseus, the
raven curls of Hector, bear the same adjective, which
cannot well be construed otherwise than as a poetic
equivalent for <i>black</i>. Nor is there any ground for
supposing that it meant to convey any special shade
or quality of blackness. Fine-drawn distinctions of
every kind are totally alien to the spirit of Homeric
diction.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f424'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r424'>424</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Iliad</i>, xxiv. 94.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The second objection to identifying cyanus with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>lapis lazuli or ultramarine related to function. The
uses to which it is put in the Iliad and Odyssey
seemed, to anxious interpreters, inconsistent with its
being either of a stony or of a glassy nature. ‘Cyanus
ordinarily enters into the composition of the polymetallic
works described in their verses. It forms,
for instance, a dark trench round the tin-fence of
the vineyard represented on the shield of Achilles;
and it is especially prominent in the decoration of the
armour of Agamemnon. Cinyras, king of Cyprus,
was the donor of this magnificent equipment; not
through pure friendship. Intimidated by the Greek
armament, he probably dreaded being compelled to
take an active share in the enterprise it aimed at
accomplishing, and purchased with a personal gift to
its supreme chief, liberty to retain his passive attitude
of ‘benevolent neutrality.’ The breastplate alone
was a ransom for royalty.</p>

<p class='c022'>Therein were ten courses of black cyanus, and twelve of
gold, and twenty of tin, and dark blue<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c017'><b>[425]</b></a> snakes writhed up towards
the neck, three on either side, like rainbows that the son
of Kronos hath set in the clouds, a marvel of the mortal tribes
of men.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c017'><b>[426]</b></a></p>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f425'>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The comparison of the snakes to rainbows may
possibly refer only to their arching shapes; it is not
easy to connect iridescence with a substance just
previously noted expressly as <i>black</i>. The shield of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Agamemnon resembled his cuirass in workmanship,
but was diversified as to pattern.</p>

<p class='c022'>‘And he took,’ we are informed, ‘the richly-dight shield of
his valour that covereth all the body of a man, a fair shield,
and round about it were twenty white bosses of tin, and one in
the midst of black cyanus. And thereon was embossed the
Gorgon fell of aspect, glaring terribly; and about her were
Dread and Terror. And from the shield was hung a baldric of
silver, and thereon was curled a snake of cyanus; three heads
interlaced had he growing out of one neck.’<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c017'><b>[427]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The Mycenæan method of inlaying bronze was
followed in the construction of both articles. But
the arrangement of the contrasted metals on the
cuirass in alternating vertical stripes, although rendered
perfectly intelligible by Helbig’s learned discussion,<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c017'><b>[428]</b></a>
has not been illustrated by any actual ‘find.’
The bosses of tin and cyanus diversifying the shield,
on the other hand, correspond strictly to a Mycenæan
plan of ornament,<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c017'><b>[429]</b></a> and are reproduced in the round
knobs of gold and silver attached to the bronze surface
of certain Phœnician dishes dug up from the
ruins of Nineveh.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c017'><b>[430]</b></a> The Gorgon’s Head, however,
does not appear in Greek art until the seventh century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>;<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c017'><b>[431]</b></a> yet the suspicion of spuriousness thence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>attaching to the lines in which it is mentioned may
prove to be unfounded. The emblem was, at least,
a favourite one in Cyprus, having been introduced
thither, according to some archæologists, from Egypt.
Judging by the evidence of Cyprian terracottas, it
figured, surrounded with serpents, very much as on
the breastplate of Agamemnon, on the corslets of
priests and kings; and it seems to have been specially
appropriated by a priestly caste named ‘Cinyrades’<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c017'><b>[432]</b></a>
to signify their supposed descent from Agamemnon’s
dubious ally. The Cyprian partiality thus manifested
for the dread device goes far towards proving that
genuine products of Cyprian metallurgy were limned
in the passages just quoted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cyanus is, then, in the Iliad employed exclusively
as an adjunct to the metallic inlaying of armour, and
it is made similarly available in the Hesiodic poems.
But in the Odyssey its sole actual use is in a frieze
surmounting the bronze-clad walls of the Phæacian
banqueting-hall. Hence many futile debates and
perplexities. The Homeric ‘cyanus,’ most critics asserted,
could not, since it was uniformly described as
<i>black</i>, be a mineral of cærulean hue, such as the
cyanus of Theophrastus unquestionably was; and it
must be presumed to have been a metal, as obtaining
a place among metals in the decorative industry of
the time. It was hence variously held to be steel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>bronze, even lead, while Mr. Gladstone at one time
thought of native blue carbonate of copper,<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c017'><b>[433]</b></a> later,
however, preferring bronze. Lepsius alone recognised
what is now generally admitted to be the truth—namely,
that the word retained its significance unchanged
from the time of Agamemnon to the time of
Theophrastus.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f433'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r433'>433</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Studies in Homer</i>, vol. iii. p. 496.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The Assyrians fabricated out of lapis lazuli, not
only personal, but architectural ornaments. Bactria
was its sole available source, and thence through the
Mesopotamian channel it reached Egypt. Among the
Babylonian spoils of Thothmes III. were a necklace of
‘true’ <i>chesbet</i>, and a gold staff jewelled with the same
beautiful mineral. Artificial <i>chesbet</i> was manufactured
in Egypt from about the fourteenth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
It was composed of a kind of glassy paste, tinted blue
with salts of copper or cobalt, and it lay piled, like
bricks for building, in the storehouses of successive
monarchs.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c017'><b>[434]</b></a> Clay-bricks, too, were enamelled with it
for use in decorative constructions, still exemplified in
the entrance to a chamber in the Sakkarah pyramid;
and the same fashion prevailed in Chaldea and Assyria.<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c017'><b>[435]</b></a>
The Egyptian admiration for <i>chesbet</i> spread
to the Peloponnesus, where an architectural function
was assigned to it agreeing most curiously with the
Odyssean use of cyanus. The spade has, on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>point, surpassed itself as an engine of research;
nothing is left to speculation; we seem to find at
Tiryns the very arrangement which caught the quick
eye of the eminent castaway in Phæacia. For in the
palace<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c017'><b>[436]</b></a> explored by Dr. Schliemann within the citadel
of Perseus, fragments of an alabaster frieze, inlaid
with dark blue smalt, were found strewn over the
floor of a vestibule, having fallen from their place on
its walls; and the smalt appears to be of precisely
the same nature with the manufactured <i>chesbet</i> of
Thothmes III., and the Cyprian and Egyptian cyanus
described by Theophrastus.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c017'><b>[437]</b></a> That it was also identical
with the substance turned to just the same architectural
account in the palace of Alcinous, may be
taken as certain; and the discovery constitutes one
of the most telling verifications of Homeric archæology.
The particular prominence of cyanus, besides,
in the Cyprian armour of Agamemnon falls in admirably
with what is known of the history of imitation
lapis lazuli; Cyprus, owing to the abundant
presence of the needful ores of copper, having become
early celebrated for its production. In addition to
some tubes of cobalt-glass, blue smalt trinkets in large
quantities have been brought to light at Mycenæ.
But if Homer took no notice of such small objects, it
was probably because he deemed them too common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>for association with the noble or divine heroines of
his song.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>That the Homeric cyanus was really a kind of
ultramarine enamel, seems, then, thoroughly established.
And it is the only form of glass recognised
in the poems. Yet the colour-difficulty survives. Our
poet remains under the imputation of inability to distinguish
black from blue—unless, indeed, we admit
with Helbig that the word ‘cyanus’ comprised a jetty
as well as an azure smalt. There is a good deal to
be said for the opinion. Theophrastus plainly distinguishes
a dark and a light variety, and even speaks
of one of the derived pigments as being <i>black</i>; and a
black enamel formed part of the materials for the
Mycenæan inlaid-work. The stripes of Agamemnon’s
cuirass were, according to this hypothesis, of black,
the curling snakes on either side of blue cyanus.
And this might help to explain the comparison of the
latter to rainbows. Not, to be sure, altogether satisfactorily,
since the likening to a simply blue object of
the brilliant arch</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mille trahens varios adverso sole colores,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>strikes the modern sense as absolutely inappropriate.
Nevertheless, we have to make allowance in Homer,
above all as regards chromatic estimates, for an <i>aliter
visum</i>. And it happens that the sole colour-epithet
bestowed by him on the rainbow is <i>porphureos</i>, signifying
purple of a peculiarly sombre shade. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>‘crocus wings’ of Iris were, then, less conspicuous
to him than her violet sandals.</p>
<p class='c015'>Amber, ivory, and cyanus, or ultramarine-enamel,
are the only non-metallic precious substances with
which Homer shows himself familiar. Precious stones
of all kinds lay apparently outside his sphere of cognisance.
Mother of pearl, coral, and rock crystal are
equally strange to him. He takes no notice of the
engraved gems of Mycenæ, no more than of the
porphyry, agate, onyx, and alabaster, there variously
employed to diversify the framework of life. No distinctions
are made in his verses between one kind of
stone and another. White jade, brought from the
furthest confines of Asia, though in some request at
Hissarlik, may not have struck him as essentially
different from any vulgar piece of flint picked up
by the shore of the Hellespont. Or, if it did, his
vocabulary was too scanty to allow of his expressing
the sentiment. Homeric mineralogy thus embraced
exceedingly few species.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
